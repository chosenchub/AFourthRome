part_of_beiyang_council_desc:0 "After the Northern Expedition, Fengtian stood as the only part left in the Beiyang Council. However, assistance from the Anhui and Shanxi allowed them to be official members of the council as well, although the council is much more decentralized than before."

#Events
anh.1.d:0 "The Anhui once stood as the absolute power within the Beiyang Government, controlling almost every aspect of the way China was run after the revolution. With Japanese support and a large army in it's hands, the Anhui seemed nearly unstoppable. However, the dawn of the May 4th Movement in 1919 caused by the Japanese getting the port of Qingdao weakened them and their Japanese support greatly. By 1920, the Anhui-Zhili war had begun, which the Anhui were defeated in.\n\nWhile the Anhui were officially ended in 1920, two governors of Shangdong and Shanghai who were part of the Anfu Club remained. Zheng Shiqi and Lu Yongxiang tried to stay neutral in Chinese politics, but by 1924 the Shanghai Anhui's neutrality was broken by the Zhili, resulting in the Anti-Zhili Coalition. The coalition of the Kuomintang, Shanghai, and Fengtian managed to beat back the Zhili Cliques numbers. However, the unity of the coalition quickly fell apart with the Kuomintang's 'Northern Expedition' in 1926 resulted in the defeat of the Shanghai Anhui Clique, but the survival of the Beiyang Government, Shanxi, and most importantly the Shangdong Anhui Clique.\n\nNow the leftovers of the Shanghai Government lie within Shangdong, an extremely Japanese influenced province with the Japanese having almost complete control of every railway in the province. While Shangdong has seen excellent economic development over the past decade due to this, Japanese influence runs so deep that people question what would happen if Zheng Shiqi were to die."
