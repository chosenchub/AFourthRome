bol.3.t:0 "The Status of Bolivia"
bol.3.d:0 "It was more than one hundred years ago when the colonists and mestizos serving under the Spanish Empire were tired of the elite's abusive rule over them, and initiated the Oruro Rebellion. Once more, that rebellious spirit is heard within the hearts of every Bolivian. It was less than a year ago that success and redemption were so close to our grasp during the Chaco War, until outside forces robbed us from our chance at victory, as well as our southern provinces, and our nation keeps being tortured by misfortune to the embarrasment to all of South America. Our people has given everything they can and yet we have failed them. Is there yet hope for peace and trust to be born yet again in Bolivia? Or are we finally on our last leg?"

bol.1.d:0 "It was no mystery to anyone the failures of our government to our people. We have lost externally and internally, Argentina has robbed us of our victory in the Chaco War, while workers are unpaid or unemployed, and everyone can see we are on our lowest point. Today, the bolivian people said no more.\n The streets of La Paz are red, as the international workers' movement known as socialism has taken to guide the misfortuned and poor majority to a better path, no more room for the elite and their own interests! Today, Bolivia is for the common man! A new Bolivia, were every person, no matter their origin, can finally be equal! It seems the revolution, has finally arrived."

As much as the elite wanted to treat us as playthings, as objects of profit and not as human beings, they have falled today, the old order is gone!. Rise up, Bolivia, Rise up, workers! Bolivia is the heart of south america, it is no surprise it is the heart of revolution, too. No longer will unequality and misery torment us, as the people, united, will be the victors!\n A new regime, a coalition of different ideological socialists under the titular leadership of charismatic activist Carlos Salazar Mostajo has been established, promising a new era for workers in Bolivia."

The fight left us unprepared, and swift they came, large in numbers, chanting in their unknown tongue, and they tore us apart. The red may have fallen today, but so have the colonials, the old elite. The indigenous peoples of Bolivia, united under a common banner have finally risen, they stood on and endured as the spaniards came, and treated them as less, and they stood on and endured as Bolivia got independence and they got the same treatment, no rights, nothing. Well now the tables are turned, and the invaders have to go now! The Caciques of Bolivia have risen, under the head of Santos Marka T'ula, and no colonial devil is allowed in our lands, we were here first, and we will be the last ones here!"

bol.11.d:0 "Diplomats from the Workers' Republic of Bolivia have come to contact us. Ever since the Chaco War a few years ago the relationship between our countries has been heavily strained, now however, more than ever, we have been pushed into requiring each other's cooperation, given our new socialist outlook. "Us the proletariat must unite against the bourgouise" they say. While we can't help but to agree, there is something they insist on. Their southern province of Tarija has been on our hands for a while, and we can't cooperate as long as it clouds our diplomatic outlook with Bolivia. Should we give it back?"

bol.20.t:0 "The Factions in the Congress"
bol.20.d:0 "As workers from all over the country arrive, three main factions have been formed that the workers identify with.\n\nFirst, prominent revolutionary Tristán Marof has accumulated a sizable following, as he defends the principles of permanent revolution, and the use of a central state as a tool to maintain and spread this revolution, which would actively guide Bolivia in following socialist principles for and by the workers. Policies like further industrialization and militarization follow from this faction's ideology.\n\nOn the other hand, the more moderate workers have reunited around Dr. José Antonio Arze, who proposes a collectivist system where the state leads the implementation of socialism, while still keeping the worker councils important as a democratic political structure to further the workers' will.\n\nFinally, the republic's current chairman, Carlos Mostajo, has formed a new political faction separate from the ruling coalition as he wishes to keep power and implement radical new reforms, granting local autonomy and more directly democratic politics that he states, are closer to the true principles of socialism."

While we all stood in a circle, the amautas – Aymara shamans – built a bonfire and made offerings, such as a dried llama fetus, for good health and fortune.

However, as the years have passed, the revolution has settled in, and many workers have been losing the revolutionary spirit that brought us together to begin with.\n\nThus a new age of revolution has to start. As the people's army marches through the streets, under the guidance of the Chairman, we will bring the revolution to every citizen once again, and to the whole world!\n\nReactions are split, and many of the political opposition have shown concern."

bol.41.t:0 "Political Opposition Arrested"
bol.41.d:0 "As the state policing agencies increase their size and activity, suddenly the arrest of prominent members of the opposition to Marof's government has happened. The charges? Treason.

So claimed Chairman Mostajo in his speech.\n\nWe established this republic as a mean to an end. To socialism and the common good. We have found good success in the way, but it isn't enough, change has to be made. Thus, today we are declaring the birth of the Commune of Bolivia! Where workers can rule themselves in autonomy and equality, without having to be disturbed by a intermediary state, and socialism will be driven from the bottom up!"
bol.43.a:0 "For the workers!"
bol.50.t:0 "Bolivia seizes Acre!"
bol.50.d:0 "Taking advantage of the situation we find ourselves at, the extremist indigenist regime that rules Bolivia has decided, in a show of aggression, to militarily seize Acre, sending its troops to annex the undefended zone, and exploiting the civil war.\n\nA direct act of invasion against our country, sadly we might have to back down from responding at least them control it for now, as opening an additional front in our current situation is a bad idea."

bol.50.b:0 "We can't let this happen."
bol.51.t:0 "Help from the Bolivian Proletariat"
bol.51.d:0 "A show of solidarity, the workers of Bolivia have united and decided to send help to their fellow comrades, us.\n\nWhatever supplies they have sent, this is truly a show of the bonds that hold the proletariat together, beyond borders."
bol.51.a:0 "Very nice!"

bol.100.t:0 "The Fate of Chile"
bol.100.d:0 "As victory came into our rightful hands, we still have decisions to take. Now that Chile is firmly under our control, we have to decide our occupation policy. Most councils approve that we rule directly the rightful Aymara shores of Atacama while granting the southern half of the country to the Mapuche, who having a history of rebellion against the colonials could make worthy allies and have claims as rightful owners of that land. Others however, believe South America must be directly ruled from our state, and not kept divided as the europeans split us. A minority, still, seems willing to keep the Chilean government as their own matters, but firmly under our grasp."

bol.102.t:0 "The Fate of Paraguay"
bol.102.d:0 "As expected, the Paraguayans couldn't stand the might of our warriors and they felt to our grasp. Now, it is time to decide what to do with them. Notable as they are, the Guarani have long stood under the colonial boot while preserving their traditions and memories. It is only fair to give them a chance to redeem themselves as our allies, free from colonial grasp. However, the opportunity to further expand our directly ruled lands is certainly attractive."

BOL_BCW_gambits_desc:0 "Brazil, the South America giant, is torn into pieces as its internal struggles have divided its nation into warring sides. Now all of South America is in a period of instability, and only those who are proactive will come out victorious from this situation. Will Bolivia be part of that group?"
BOL_seize_acre:0 "Seize Acre"
BOL_seize_acre_desc:0 "Long ago lost, a sell forced by Brazilian pressure, the land of Acre is a fundamental piece of the Amazons, the beautiful South American jungle, and should be ruled by its true native owners. Now, Brazil is divided, and they won't be able to react if we seize Acre back. Whoever lives there would be grateful to be freed from the marxist yoke, anyways."

BOL_help_brunion_desc:0 "Brave Comrades in Brazil have risen against the oligarchy, but are under attack by reactionary forces. We must support the rightful rulers of Brazil, the workers, sending them weapons for their fight."
