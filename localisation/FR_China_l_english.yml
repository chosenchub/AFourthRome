chi.0.t:0 "The New China"
chi.0.d:0 "October 10, 1911. Double Ten Day. The fateful moment when China was dragged out of its isolationist slumber and of the millennia-old dynastic cycle. Intellectual Chinese exiles combined forces with the Beiyang Army, the most elite and modern forces of the Qing Empire, to finally end the Century of Humiliation. Or so the hopeful revolutionaries thought.\n\nWhen the rest of the world was killing each other in the Great War, the Middle Kingdom instead faced an internal conflict. The leader of the Beiyangs, General Yuan Shikai, betrayed the revolution by attempting to crown himself emperor. The intricate weave of political alliances unraveled as regional warlords abandoned the central government to form their own cliques. However, not all hope was lost for China. Sun Yat-sen, the winner of the only free elections in the once-united China, used his influence to form a new party in 1919: the Kuomintang -- the Nationalist Party.\n\nThe Kuomintang would become the heart of a new Republic of China; one where passionate revolutionaries, not military strongmen, led the nation. Over the course of a decade, Sun Yat-sen would unify the country, accepting anyone into his party who upheld the Three Principles: Nationalism, Democracy, and Socialism. A brief health scare in 1925 aside, Sun Yat-sen saw through the unification of the south, held together with an alliance with the small but influential Communist Party. The first free elections since 1911 were held in 1926, where Sun Yat-sen ran virtually unopposed. One year later, Sun Yat-sen mobilized the National Revolutionary Army for a fullscale invasion of the last rotting remnants of the old Beiyang-led Republic of China. Although minor warlords resisted central authority in Western China and in Mongolia, the end of the Northern Expidition in 1929 was considered the ultimate triumph of the Kuomintang as the sole legitimate Chinese government.\n\nHowever, with the end of the Warlord Era, a new crisis was brewing within China. While no one dares to criticize Sun Yat-sen openly, certain elements within the National Revolutionary Army, particularly the hero of the Northern Expidition, General Bai Chongxi, question Sun Yat-sen's continued alliance with the Communists and his latest rounds of land redistributation. Meanwhile, Premier Liao Zhongkai, the architect of said alliance, is likewise afraid of a conspiracy to utterly betray Sun Yat-sen's legacy. It's clear to everyone, except perhaps Sun himself, that the Kuomintang is splitting into twain. And as his disease is catching up to him, both ringleaders are preparing for the worst. The Father of the Nation is not long for this world, and the Kuomintang is only big enough for one visionary..."

chi.1.t:0 "Double Ten Day"
chi.1.d:0 "On October 10th, 1911, elements of the Qing New Army mutinied against against their officers in Wuchang District, Wuhan, after it was discovered that Sun-Yat Sen and the Tongmenghui had returned to the mainland. The mutinying soldiers pledged their loyalty to the Tongmenghui, which would evolve into the modern Kuomingtang Party over the next decade. The Wuchang Uprising, as it would later be known, successfully drove the Qing loyalists out of the city, becoming the opening battle of the Xinhai Revolution. Only four months later, the Qing Empire would completely capitulate to the revolutionaries, forming the modern republican era.\n\nPeople in every Chinese village and city, regardless of political affiliation, fill the streets to celebrate China's rise into the modern world. Lion dances, parades of uniformed soldiers and public servants, and fireworks are common forms of celebration throughout the country. No matter what happens in China, the horrors of the backwards and repressive Qing Empire will never again rear its ugly head, and that alone is cause for celebration."
chi.1.a:0 "Without the Kuomintang, there would be no China!"
chi.2.t:0 "30th Anniversary of Double Ten Day"
chi.2.d:0 "On October 10th, 1911, elements of the Qing New Army mutinied against against their officers in Wuchang District, Wuhan, after it was discovered that Sun-Yat Sen and the Tongmenghui had returned to the mainland. The mutinying soldiers pledged their loyalty to the Tongmenghui, which would evolve into the modern Kuomingtang Party over the next decade. The Wuchang Uprising, as it would later be known, successfully drove the Qing loyalists out of the city, becoming the opening battle of the Xinhai Revolution. Only four months later, the Qing Empire would completely capitulate to the revolutionaries, forming the modern republican era.\n\nNot even the scars of the civil war could prevent the celebration of this momentous occasion. 1941 marks the 30th year since the beginning of the republican era of China. Local communities spared no expense on this year's lion dances, parades, and fireworks, creating if only for a day a political truce between the feuding factions of China. A whole generation of Chinese citizens have lived their lives free of the four thousand year old institution of the dynastic cycle. Those who can remember the stagnation of the Qing Dynasty and the derogation China suffered under their banners know that even the lowest points of the republican era do not even begin to compare to those dark years. Soon, China will heal from her Century of Humiliation, and rise once again as the center of the civilized world!"

### 3 - : Pre-Civil war Flavour###
chi.3.t:0 "The May Fourth Movement"
chi.3.d:0 "The May Fourth Movement continues to grow in Sun's republic. Originally a student movement that sprang out of their growing disgust towards both the imperialism of the European powers and the failure of the early revolutionary government to counter them, and on the morning of the fourth of May 1919, this boiled over. Students assaulted an official linked to the Japanese and burnt down his home, the first protest in a decades long rage aimed against the current Chinese establishment. \n\n Despite's Sun Yat Sen's official disapproval of the movement, claiming that it was harming the morals of China's youth, the movement has gone on to dominate urban Chinese politics. Students, intellectuals, unions, or anyone that feels abandoned by the revolution within China's coastal cities now openly rejects the tradionalist values of China's dynastic past in a myraid of ways; many only wear western clothing, young women campaigned vigorously against the practice of foot binding, some openly boycott foreign goods while violently harassing merchants who dare to sell them, while others have embraced to western ideologies such as Valkism or Collectivism. Although decentralised, the beating heart of the movemnet lies in the progressive city of Guangzhou where many linked to the movement raise funds or organise potests from.\n\n By 1936, the movement slows no signs of slowling down as despite Sun's reforms, large swaths of China lag behind, corruption and banditry clinging to the nation like a cancer. It is unlikely that the movement will be silenced anytime soon."
chi.3.a:0 "Disrespectful Hooligans! All of them!"
chi.3.b:0 "Their anger is justified, but do they expect us to perform miracles?"
chi.3.c:0 "...we only need more time. We can only hope they're patient."
chi.10.t:0 "Sun Yat-Sen has passed away"
chi.10.d:0 "An unthinkable tragedy has hit us.\n\nThe KMT had tried to hide it from public view for so long, but after years of deteriorating health, President Sun has finally passed away. He was battling liver cancer, and although he seemingly won his fight in 1925, it finally relapsed in the mid 30s.\n\nNow the father of our republic is at rest, and funeral preparations are already underway. Madame Sun was with him till his final moments, and she wishes for us to respect her spouse's request for a christian funeral.\n\nOur government is still reeling from the news. The future is uncertain. "
chi.10.a:0 "The Sons and Daughters of China are left Fatherless."
chi.12.t:0 "The snap election"
chi.12.d:0 "Sun's passing didn't leave much time for rest for the KMT. His charisma brought the various factions of the KMT together, now the KMT National Congress has called for an emergency election to elect a new adminstration for the republic. In the days since, two big umbrella groups have emerged.\n\nLiao Zhongkai, Sun's own protégé has been assumed by many to be the obvious choice, and he has gained the support of the intellectuals, the nascent labour movement, both left-leaning and outright leftists and of course, those loyal to Sun and his establishment.\n\nAll is not perfect for Liao though. The May Fourth Movement, critical of Sun's more cautious and conservative actions fear that Liao Zhongkai will slow down China's progress further. The ever-growing women's rights movement have been critical of Sun's reluctance on including women in the direction of the KMT, and despite his wife's far more cordial attitude, she has disapointed many by choosing not to run. Instead Liao has been silent, and support among activists for him as been cold\n\nBut most dangerous of challengers comes in the form of one man; Bai Chongxi, the hero of the Northern Expedition himself.\n\nBai Chongxi has gained the support of sizable elements of the NRA, the conservative wing of the KMT, business owners and even the more disraught members of political movements such as May Fourthers who feel a strong legislative leader will be the change China needs to catch up with the west.\n\nTensions that have been boiling even before the president's passing look set to erupt. Small bouts of violenve have even been reported. There is nothing nor no one to reenforce civility."
chi.12.a:0 "China steels herself."
chi.13.t:0 "The KMT's direction"
chi.13.d:0 "How shall the KMT organise itself in this post-Sun era?\n\n Liao Zhongkai is advocating a policy of 'Civil Renewal' which seeks to raise the income, education and opportunities of the Chinese people through an expansion of the tiny education sector, creating a basic welfare program while investing and diversifying into new sectors of the economy. While his message resonates with urban chinese and those who see it as a practical path to acheiving Sun's ideals, other feel that the Chinese state cannot support all of Liao's proposals, or outright lambast him for what they perceive as a slow and misguided direction.\n\nIn contrast, Bai Chongxi has opted for his 'Iron Will' platform, his wishes to accelerate Sun's industrialisation ten-fold, by focusing educational investment into trade and manufacturing skills only while expanding more industries into China's interior. He feels this will be far more practical in uplifting China's poor, but he has received criticism that such a heavily focus will leave the people without important needs such as healthcare or civilian infrastructure. He has not taken such criticism well, calling his opponents in the congress 'western lapdogs'. He has also advocated beginning a second major expedition to bring the rebellious Anhui warlords to heel and to draw Manchuria and it's 'imperialist lackeys' into the sea, all with a major expansion of the ranks of the NRA, alongside a massive push for modernisation. This pits him directly against Liao's own defence policy, despite sharing the same stance for army modernisation, he is instead pursuing a 'diplomacy first, war only if needed' stance.\n\nBoth Liao and Bai's followers have relayed their beliefs over the press, pamphlets and village-to-village rallies. One of their beliefs is resonating with the populace..."
chi.13.a:0 "The KMT must enrich and empower the Chinese people!"
chi.13.b:0 "The KMT shall be the shield of China, and will defeat those who wish to betray us!"
chi.14.t:0 "China's nascent industry"
chi.14.d:0 "China has modernised by leaps and bounds compared to the pitiful attempts of the Qing less than a century ago, but despite such progress it lags behind the European powers. Manchuria and it's vast resources are increasingly under foreign control, wealth flows out of Shnaghai and other foreign legations like a river stream, while Japan and it's enviable strength remains a shameful look at what could have been.\n\nBoth Liao, Bai and their respective followers argue and debate endlessly on how to bring China forward into the future."
chi.14.a:0 "Exploitation and inefficiency must end before we mindlessly expand."
chi.14.b:0 "The government must pour more resources into bolstering our economy."
chi.15.t:0 "The Nuzi Canzheng Tongmenghui protest across China"
chi.15.d:0 "The Nuzi Canzheng Tongmenghui (The Alliance for Female Participation in Politics) is an umbrella organisation dedicated to women's rights in the republic. As the election heats up, the Alliance has organised suprisingly sizable marches in Nanjing, Shanghai and Beijing among others. With the passing of Sun, their leadership has constantly campaigned to make the uplifting of Chinese women a prominent policy for the upcomig decade, and for the KMT to finally open its parliament to female candidates. Liao has only discussing in secret with his close aides, and despite a cordial speech by Madame Sun that was received surprisingly well, the protests have turned increasinly tense and even violent.\n\nBai has been agitating for direct and swift action, while Liao continues to weigh his options. Whichever side chooses to act first will surely anger and galvanise the other."
chi.15.a:0 "Liao agrees to some of their policy ideas, and in return the protesters stand down."
chi.15.b:0 "Bai leads his troops to sucessfully disperse the Nanjing protesters."
chi.16.t:0 "An increasingly divided NRA"
chi.16.d:0 "The National Revolutionary Army is China's main military force, born from Sun's now legendary northern expedition to purge warlordism. The reality is that most warlords instead defected to the KMT, and still hold their independent streak.\n\nThe election has been rough on the unity of the KMT. Calls of 'Traitor','Lapdog'and other such insults are increasingly common among the command. Even the general infanrty find themselves increasinly bound to the events transpiring around them, their main loyalty still being to their own commanders rather than Nanjing.\n\nBai Chongxi is extremely popular among the NRA's veterans, the memories of the expedition still fresh. His desire to bring the outer provinces of Mongolia and Manchuria to heel as soon as possible greatly excites the more jingoistic elements of the NRA. He also advocates the expansion of the NRA's general staff, while also allowing the commanders to strategise with more independence from the wishes of Nanjing politicians.\n\nHis openess is costing him too, however. Many view Liao's official stance, crafted by NRA elements loyal to him, focuses instead on expanding equipment manufacturing to bring artillery, specialist infantry and other such beacons of modernity to as many divisions in the NRA as possible before anything else, while giving power to junior officers to craft a more flexible support structure. This, to his relief, has found Liao support among the newer graduates of the military academies. Bai Chongxi's aggresive stance has also alienated many officers who fear China is not ready for striking out. His increasingly open agressiveness against the Chinese Soviet Republic, Nanjing's main ally in the northern expedition, is frightening NRA elements who feel his stance will destroy their relationship with what is defacto their only military ally. Others simply fear far-left retribution and wish he'd hold his tongue for now, but to no avail.\n\nNeedless to say, the NRA is splintering fast."
chi.16.a:0 "Liao will make the NRA relevant in this rapidly modernising world!"
chi.16.b:0 "Politicians like him have no right to step all over our protectors!"
chi.17.t:0 "The election turns increasingly violent"
chi.17.d:0 "Election day is close.\n\nAcross our major cities, the elctions have begun engulfing it's people into a frenzy. In Beijing increasingly larger crowds of people have taken to the streets, both in the support and oppostion of Bai Chongxi. NRA elements loyal to Bai have begun assaulting protestors, which have only galvanising opposition to his candidacy. Many in the streets or in letters written to both the congress and the press that they are voting in Liao just to oppose Bai, which has further enraged his faction. Howver, Liao loyalists have also begun agitating in the streets, and many moderates have become increasingly wary of throwing their full weight behing Liao as his followers turn increasingly radical.\n\nIn Shanghai, many who have grown infatuated with Bai's anti-imperialist stance have begun rioting against the heavy western presense in the city, the latest incident being a crowd of angry protestors burning down a casino infamous for it's underground cover as a prositiution ring. Smaller but no less chaotic incidents have taken place wherever foreign legations can be found.\n\nOfficers loyal to Liao or Bai have alrady declared for them, several divisions have even killed or arrested their higher commanders, and skirmishes have taken place in Shanxi and Yunnan.\n\nProtestors in the last few days have already dug in, fortifications are increasingly common, and the various police districts have either been violent in their explusion or refused to carry out their orders, pledging to the candisdate of their choice.\n\nThe global press has been ceaselessly reporting on our increasingly volatile situation, and we fear the foreign vultures may already be circling, biding their time."
chi.17.a:0 "Only Sun's own protege is worthy! Death to Bai and his lackeys!"
chi.17.b:0 "An actual hero is what we need! Death to Liao and his lackeys!"
chi.18.t:0 "Liao Zhongkai wins!"
chi.18.d:0 "The ballots have been counted, and the results are out; Liao Zhongkai has managed to seize the higher parity in votes. He has won.\n\nAcross the republic, the news brings a storm of emotions. His supporters are estatic, many taking to the streets in celebration, or instead launch retributions against Bai's supporters. Many moderates are now holding their breath, hoping for the best. Intellectuals have already begun writing their reflections on what this victory entails.\n\nAnd then there are his opponents. Bai Chongxi, having found refuge in Beijing amidst the chaos, a city which saw a majority vote him in, thanked the city first before descending into an increasingly heated tirade against Liao and his supporters. He has called the elction fradulent, and his supporters have reportedly launched violent protests across our cities.\n\nLiao is less than pleased, and does not share the elation of his followers. Whispers abound within KMT that he fears he cannot live up to Sun's now legendary legacy, even now that he is in power. Despite this, in front of a crowd of ferverent supporters, he makes a speech, his greying hair fluttering in Nanjing's cool evening breeze, where he promises to do whatever he can to live up to Sun's Three Principles at any cost."
chi.18.a:0 "Sun's disciple himself! Three cheers for Liao Zhongkai!"
chi.19.t:0 "Bai Chongxi wins!"
chi.19.d:0 "The ballots have been counted, and the results are out; Bai Chongxi has managed to seize the higher parity in votes. He has won.\n\nThe results have shocked the republic, the election of Bai has proven the KMT's greatest fear to be correct, that simply riding on Sun Yat-Sen's legacy isn't enough. Bai was reportedly infected with joy, proclaiming in front of a crowd of estatic supporters for a national holiday to celebrate. As his aides enjoyed a round of drinks, the atmosphere in Nanjing could not be any more different.\n\nRiots have reportedly erupted across our cities, Liao's furious supporters have begun tearing down election posters of Bai, attacking his headquaters and it's employees, killing three and injuring more. Clashes with the police have spilled blood.\n\nBai Chongxi has promised to make the enemies of China pay, and declared in front of his supporters in his closing words that only he and he alone can ensure that Sun's legacy be preserved."
chi.19.a:0 "The man has done so much for China! A well deserved victory!"
