#### GENERIC DECISIONS ####

increase_popularity_vang:0 "Have [Root.GetLeader] hold a speech" #Might and Strength.
increase_popularity_vang_desc:0 "Some may criticize us for advocating a strong state... Let them criticize! A strong state is the only way to achieve Karl Marx's envisionment of Socialism; we will go as far as necessary; and we will be sure the People are aware of that."
increase_popularity_collie:0 "Popularize Marxist Literature" #Revolutionary and Orthodox.
increase_popularity_collie_desc:0 "The way forward is together. The Vanguardists will argue that a strong state is necessary to guide the people to true Socialism, Libertarian Socialists will argue for the opposite. Neither of these parties are correct; mutual co-dependence and ensuring Unity of the collective will be required to truly achieve Socialism."
increase_popularity_libsoc:0 "Have [Root.GetLeader] make Factory visits" #Equal and United.
increase_popularity_libsoc_desc:0 "Putting large amounts of power in the hands of few is a one-way trip to a Dictatorship. A partially Socialist system must be applied to our nation; to steadily and moderately work towards the Marxist dream of Socialism. Making Factory visits to our workers to inform them of this will ensure our popularity and discredit the radical regimes proposed by some."
increase_popularity_socdem:0 "Expansive welfare distribution" #Fair and Moderate.
increase_popularity_socdem_desc:0 "Capitalism is flawed, but it is our duty to repair those flaws. Humane ethics must be applied to Capitalism in order to soften its rough outcome on the working classes. We will be the ones to take up that mantle; we will be the ones to reform, to fix our nation today so that a better one can exist tomorrow. "

increase_popularity_soccon:0 "Promote the Status Quo" #Stable and Traditional.
increase_popularity_soccon_desc:0 "Some may criticize us for our refusal to change many things, but they simply don't see that our national situation is optimal as-of current. Tradition and Stability are a few of the vital life-forces in a nation. We can never give either of these up to the radical forces of reform and revolution, and the people must know that."
increase_popularity_authdem:0 "Broadcast our Responsibility" #Popular and Responsible.
increase_popularity_authdem_desc:0 "'Authoritarianism applied to the Democratic system' is how some would describe us. However that is hardly a bad thing.
