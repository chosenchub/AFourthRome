#Description
FRA_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "Victorious, but at what cost? Many Frenchmen found themselves asking this in the aftermath of the Great War. France had reclaimed its rightful land, and established a protectorate over the Rheinland to prevent the Germans from ever threatening La Patrie ever again. However as the 1930s come to an end, France's position in Europe and the world is increasingly threatened, with a hostile British Empire threatening France's colonies and a increasingly belligerent Soviet Union, but perhaps of the greatest concern is a resurgent Germany. France will need cunning, bravery, and excellent diplomacy to emerge from the coming storm unscathed."

### Army ###

FRA_the_land_army:0 "Armée de Terre"
FRA_the_land_army_desc:0 "Despite emerging victorious from the Great War, our army is in poor shape. While our men are well equipped, the Great War saw France undergo a huge demographic loss of men from the ages of eighteen to twenty five. If we are to keep Europe safe from the German menace, we must ensure our army is in top shape."
FRA_mechanized_warfare:0 "Mass Mechanization"
FRA_mechanized_warfare_desc:0 "Charles de Gaulle, a Land Army officer, has expressed sentiments in favour of using tanks, mechanized infantry, planes, and other types of armour as the primary doctrine for the Land Army. While his ideas are not popular with the French high command, perhaps it is time we began to use offensive tactics?"
FRA_motorized_infantry:0 "Motorized Infantry"
FRA_motorized_infantry_desc:0 "Using motorized infantry, which is much quicker than regular infantry, we can move at high speeds towards the enemy’s position and squeeze out a quick victory!"
FRA_airplane_technology:0 "Airplane Technology"

FRA_offensive_training:0 "Offensive Training"
FRA_offensive_training_desc:0 "The Land Army has operated on a doctrine of defence during and following the Great War. It is important that we teach our soldiers to take initiative, so that our men can carry out their orders to best of their abilities."
FRA_levee_en_masse:0 "Mass Levy"
FRA_levee_en_masse_desc:0 "Levée en masse, or mass levy, was a policy of mass conscription adopted by France during the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789. Since we are lacking in manpower, perhaps we could look to conscript older men into the army..."
FRA_mass_production_of_infantry_equipment:0 "Arms Standardization"

FRA_careful_planning:0 "Mass Planning"
FRA_careful_planning_desc:0 "It would be best to plan for each and every scenario as that would ensure that we will be prepared and ready for anything that may come our way. In addition, building more forts on the Alsace-Rhine line will intimidate the Germans, ensuring that they will not act up."
FRA_military_academies:0 "Military Academies"
FRA_military_academies_desc:0 "Encouraging civilians to enrol in military academies  will help widen and develop our officer pool, giving us more of the finest minds to choose from."
FRA_alsace_rhine_line:0 "Alsace-Rhine Line"
FRA_alsace_rhine_line_desc:0 "The Alsace-Rhine Line, our primary defence against the German menace, has served well to deter the Germans from attacking us. Therefore, it is only natural that we continue to develop the existing fortifications further."
FRA_the_guard_on_the_rhine:0 "The Guard on the Rhine"
FRA_the_guard_on_the_rhine_desc:0 "After the Great War, we saw to it that the German menace had been permanently weakened, so that they could never embroil Europe in yet another conflict. We, the French, are the true guardians of the Rhine and, by extension, the guardians of Europe. Vive la France!"
FRA_the_army_reformed:0 "The Army Reformed"

### Navy ###

FRA_national_navy:0 "Marine Nationale"
FRA_national_navy_desc:0 "The National Navy, or the Marine Nationale, the pride of France. Our navy has been in top shape, unlike our army, and is capable of securing the motherland and the colonies. However, to ensure our navy remains modern, we must continue researching new naval technology."

fra.1.t:0 "The plane dispute"
fra.1.d:0 "Since we have begun to take an interest in reforming the Air Army, disputes on what type of plane to focus on have sprung up. A portion of the aerial high command supports investing in bomber planes while another part supports research fighter plane technology. Which one shall we choose?"
fra.2.d:0 "After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the Second French Empire under Napoleon III had fallen and in its place rose the French Third Republic. Because of the disastrous loss against the German Empire, France had been eager to rebuild its industry, armed forces, and exact revenge on the German Empire. \n\nOn the 28th of July, 1914, exactly 43 years later, France had its opportunity when the Great War had broken out. Despite facing heavy resistance from its German foe, France was able to hold out long enough, through the use of trench warfare, when the German finally enacted the Schlieffen Plan which saw Germany invade neutral Belgium. Because of its obligation to Belgium through the Treaty of London of 1839, Britain was forced to enter the war on the side of the Entente. \n\nWhile France had had many close calls during the war, such as the Miracle of Marne which saw the British and French successfully defend Paris against the German onslaught, it eventually managed to fight off Germany until 1920, when an armistice was signed between the Entente and the Central Powers. \n\nFollowing the end of the Great War, France regained Alsace-Lorraine, which it had lost to the Germans following the Franco-Prussian War, a Rhenish puppet state was created to ensure that France could defeat the German menace at a moments notice, and the former German colonies of Cameroon and part of the German Gold Coast were given to France. \n\nDespite everything seemingly going well for France, old rivalries with Britain flared up, yet again, and saw the Entente split into two factions; the Continental Entente, lead by France, and the Imperial Protection Alliance, lead by Britain. France also faces numerous problems at home and abroad. Since the Great War was mostly fought in France, the French Republic now faces a demographic problem in which it has a shortage of 18-25 year olds. In addition, the army has grown stagnant, resisting reform. Furthermore, the German menace has been rising under the Valkist Adam Dressler, who has quickly consolidated power, promising to ‘right the wrongs’ of the Great War. France now faces many problems, both home and abroad. The question is, can she deal with them and persevere? Or is she doomed to fall yet again..."
fra.3.t:0 "Land Army doctrine dispute"
fra.3.d:0 "Due to the rather poor state of our army, it is clear that reformation is a top priority if we are to keep our army modern and intimidating enough to stave off the German menace. However, the Army High Command has been paralyzed because they are unable to come to a consensus on what doctrine our army should use. In order to settle the debate, once and for all, and bring back the glory of the Armée de terre, we choose the doctrine of..."
fra.4.d:0 "While much of the naval high command believes that battleships will continue to remain as the dominant capital ship, a portion of the high command is of the belief that carriers and naval aircraft in general will have a bigger role to play in the coming years of naval warfare. Either way, we have two choices in front of us. Do we support the orthodox tactics, or should we try something new?"
fra.5.d:0 "The new policy of conscription has been extremely unpopular with the French populace. Because of the losses sustained during the Great War, most, if not all, Frenchman are reluctant to go to war for the state. Opposition to this policy has been shown with various riots within some of the most populated areas of France. Infrastructure and factories have been destroyed by the rioters and stores have been looted. We must remedy the situation immediately, lest the French Republic falls into anarchy."
fra.6.d:0 "This time, the Communist Party of France have joined the rioters to protest conscription. More rioting has occurred in various regions, with looting and anarchy now commonplace in many places. This conflict is reaching a boiling point and may pose an actual threat to the French Republic."
fra.7.d:0 "Due to the amount of riots - both past and present - the French government has finally decided that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. We've two options in front of us: either we can negotiate with the leftists and try and reach a compromise or we can greatly reduce their power."
fra.8.d:0 "We've sat down with the head of the rioters, Maurice Thorez, who has told us that, unless the policy is repealed, the riots will not end. While we can, in theory, end the policy of conscription, it is crucial that we have men ready to serve in the Land Army. Alternatively, if we were to reduce conscription; it'd likely satisfy enough of the populace and then leave the Rioters without any support. What shall we do?"
fra.9.d:0 "It turns out our efforts at dispersing the Communists with force was in vain. Whilst we did manage to disperse them for a period of time; they ended up reorganising anyways. Once again, the Reds are screaming their lungs out in the streets of Paris and Caen protesting our efforts to silence them. They've garnered significant amounts of sympathy from onlookers and have increased the amount of Radicals in our beloved nation."
fra.10.d:0 "Since the reorganization of the Reds, they have been agitating throughout France and demanding an end of Conscription. There have been scuffles with the Police and Reds throughout various locations in our nation, a prominent area being Normandie. This situation has evolved into a powderkeg, however it seems that the only way to prevent this from getting worse is by taking all measures we can to ensure the Communists don't make the situation worse than it currently is... Lest the rioting gets even worse..."
fra.12.d:0 "Horrible news, today it seems the London stock exchange has plunged into a state of total meltdown. Following mass selling of stocks, it seems a majority of the world has been shaken worse than imaginable. Fortunately, given that the British have forced harsh tariffs on us during the interwar which shut us out of their economy; we haven't been as badly affected as some other nations. Regardless, we will persevere. We will defend the status quo in Europe, and we will not shy away from war because of some puny economic stagnation. Millions have died in the Great war, if we must make our Economic situation worse to prevent such another war from happening; so be it."

fra.34.d:0 "We desperately lack men. That much is obvious. There are nowhere near as many recruits signing up regularly for us to substantially expand our Military, which is absolutely crucial in the face of a hyper-aggressive Germany.\n\n However, we can combat this in various ways. Need be; we can direct recruits from colonial territories to serve in auxiliary roles in the Armee d'Terre. French Indochina is the perfect place for such an endeavour."
fra.35.d:0 "The French have been conducting Conscription in our territory! They're conducting conscription campaigns in our land and directing actual volunteers into the Armee d'Terre! Given their control of us there is little we can do to protest this audacious move..."
fra.36.d:0 "The Germans have broke through the Alsace-Rhine line! We must fully mobilize! We have severely underestimated the Germans, we must stop them here or fall! Everything we can muster will be used against the Germans, we've scrambled together a defensive plan to respond to this breakthrough and have pressed Great-War arms into service!"
fra.37.d:0 "Great news! It seems that the ongoing war has stimulated our economy! It seems to be stirring, perhaps this may be one of the few fruits of this war..."
fra.38.d:0 "It is often said that Friends who wish to remain Friends shouldn't talk about politics or religion. Whilst, the latter may not be particularly relavent at this moment; the former surely is. Philippe Petain and Francois Darlan, a set of good friends, have been discussing the status of the German menace during their personal visit to Petain's villa. Both men have come to the agreement that the Republic is responsible for the lack of action against Germany rather than France herself; and even the possibility of a coup was discussed concerning a method of ending the dangerous Republican government.\n\nRegardless, only one conclusion was reached during the midst of these heated conversations..."
fra.39.d:0 "Starting at approximately 2:34 AM, the Armee de Terre initiated its Coup. Within hours, the key locations throughout the nation were pacified, notably Paris, Brest and Marseille. Dentention of Politicians (mainly leftist) has been enacted, and various political posts have been abolished entirely in place of the new regime. With the Navy and Army firmly on our side, we've been able to properly control the situation without too much resistance.\n\nUnfortunately, the Airforce wasn't as firmly on our side. A sizeable portion of our air staff have attempted to remain loyal to the Republican Government, and we've been faced with little option but to eliminate them."
fra.40.d:0 "As the Junta strengthens its control over the country, we're going to need to make a series of decisions as to how we're going to solidify our hold over France. Of course, like any regime, the right to rule exists at a great price.\n\nFor now, we're faced with the question of dissidents within our society. First and foremost, it's likely for the best that we eliminate these dissidents in order to stamp out any further resistance. However, that might further estrange the population; not to say that they haven't been estranged yet, however it'd certainly make matters more uncomfortable for them."
fra.41.d:0 "Recently, an inevitable question has cropped up following the establishment of our new regime. Precisely the matters of our economy and its structuring. At the moment, we've retained semi-privatized markets which were favoured by the Third Republic. Of course, we can outright nationalize industries and put them under state-control, or we can work with the current system by completely privatizing the markets, a form of Market Autocracy."
fra.42.d:0 "Concerning our populace, it's likely a good idea that we decide on how to handle the youth. Of course, the Armee de Terre always needs more recruits, and thus combat training is a rather enticing option, however political indoctrination can ensure that the youth remains firmly loyal to our cause."
fra.43.d:0 "The French Radical-Left has been a problem since times immemorial, today we are to decide on how we should punish them. Now, without a doubt, being a socialist is a crime within our society, as socialists seek to undermine the principles and ethics that France is structured around. They're a direct threat to the Fatherland. Whilst detaining these socialists isn't much of a concern, how we punish them is. We can get rid of them by deporting them to the Colonies, or simply imprison them in recorrectional facilities. Alternatively, we can instead make them serve their sentence in the Armee de Terre, which could bolster the ranks of our Army at the cost of allowing these socialists to avoid imprisonment."
fra.44.d:0 "It's been 2 months since the Junta ended the Republic which became a detriment to the survival of France. No longer shall France find herself blocked off from Glory by Democracy, no longer shall France be ignored and dismissed, no longer shall France find herself unwilling and unable to act; the New Regime will accomplish what the old could not. As our position in power has been firmly secured, we can safetly look outwards and bring honour to the name of France."

# - East Africa Revolt Stuff

fra.50.d:0 "Reports from British Kenya have indicated that a revolt has begun spreading across the region, spurred on by poor working conditions and lack of political independence. British authorities have moved quickly to stamp out the rebellion from fear that it will spread across their African colonies. In their weakness however, we find ourselves with opportunity.\n\nGiven the poor state of relations between our two nations some within our Government have begun suggesting that we use this issue to take a stand against British rule in Africa, either through a formal condemnation or by directly sending supplies to the rebels in an effort to prolong the rebellion. The condemnation is likely to be ignored by Britain, but sending supplies to the rebels is likely only to anger the British deeply. It is our choice to make in the matter however."
fra.51.d:0 "The French Foreign Ministry made a statement this morning regarding our attempts to quell the on-going revolt in East Africa. Stating that our rule in the region has done nothing to assist in the development of the native peoples and that we have brought nothing but fear and destruction to Africa, the French Foreign Minister concluded with the demand that we change our attitudes towards our African colonies for the benefit of the natives, rather than for our own selfish needs.\n\nSuch a statement is mostly rhetoric, but with passions high in our Government over this statement there is a growing movement to demand the French retract their statement."
fra.52.d:0 "Reports from local commanders involved in restoring order to outlying regions in British East Africa have indicated a signficant surge in rebel activity following rumours of French equipment being shipped to assist in their revolt against our rule. Such an action has significantly hampered out ability to once more bring order to our territory, with High Command expecting it to take several more months than previously thought to fully crush the rebels.\n\nGovernment response has been predictable, largely angered by French meddling in our internal affairs the two favourite choices of our Ministers is either issue a demand to the French Government to cease supplying the rebels with arms, or bring proof of French involvement to the world stage in an attempt to garner diplomatic backing across the world."
fra.53.d:0 "In response to our condemnation of British rule in Arica, the British Government yesterday evening summoned our Ambassador to immediately explain our Government's move. Additionally, the British representative in Paris lodged a formal diplomatic protest over what they call 'French meddling in internal British affairs'."
fra.54.d:0 "This morning our Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and representative in London, was summoned by the Foreign Office where the the British proceeded to demand that we formally retract our condemnation of British rule in Africa. Naturally our Government is largely unphased by such a demand, and it is unlikely that the British will pursue the matter any further."
fra.55.d:0 "Yesterday evening the British Foreign Secretary held an urgent press conference with newspapers and media of the United Kingdom. Presenting so-called 'proof' of our involvement in sending supplies to British East Africa, the British Foreign Secretary demanded the immediate halt of French aid to the rebel forces, calling it a brazen act of interference in the affairs of another Great Power.\n\nDiplomatically this press conference has caused quite a stir around the world, though many within our Government believe that it will largely blow over in the coming weeks."
fra.56.d:0 "In response to our demands that their Government cease all funding and supply shipments to the rebels in East Africa, the French Government has so far refused to respond to any of our statements. Our Government does not believe that a response will be forthcoming - and that in order to save face and prevent a precedent being set for foreign involvement in our affairs - that our response must be harsh and immediate. As such, we are prepared to launch an immediate embargo on the French nation."
fra.57.d:0 "While some in our Government believed that British demands to cease funding and supplying rebels in their East Africa possessions was largely hot air, it would seem that the British were willing to follow through on their threats if we did not stop arms shipments immediately. As such the British Government has issued an embargo on our nations goods."

While this is a very large number of guns, we would be able to both reap a monetary benifit as well as increasing our influence with Hungary. What shall we do?"

frahun.2.d:0 "We have received an official request from the Hungarian delegation, they wish to officially join the Continental Entente. While relations with Hungary have been improving quite rapidly over the past months, this is still a very large decision for us to make. Allowing Hungary to join may permenantly sour relations with the other Balkan nations, and may lead to problems in the future. Alternativly, allowing Hungary to join will give us a strong foothold in the region, and will allow us to further increase our influence in the neighboring countries. This will also serve to curtail any Soviet or German expansionism in the area, and will allow us to attack from several directions if war ever breaks out."
frahun.2.a:0 "An alliance with the Policeman of the Balkans? Of course!"
frahun.2.b:0 "It is not within our best interests."

frafla.1.d:0 "The MAS-FAL rifle is a concept project that is based on the possible advent of purely-firepower based warfare.  The Rifle itself would be Automatic and utilize a rifle-sized calibre, and able to use exchangeable magazines in a similar fashion to what submachineguns are able to do. The rifle would act as a cross between a submachinegun and a Light Machinegun, being lighter and much more manoeuvrable. \n\n However, one problem is that the rifle is incredibly expensive to manufacture, and it looks as if it will take a large portion of time for MAS to correct those issues... It may be quite some time before we can even consider adopting it..."
frafla.2.d:0 "We've been planning the Paris Colonial Exposition since last year, mainly due to attacks on us by German and Soviet diplomats due to our colonial holdings. Surely, the answer to this problem would be to hold a festival of sorts which would paint our Colonial Empire in a beneficial light. However, we're faced with a question; what shall the Paris Colonial Exposition be centred around?"
frafla.3.d:0 "If we want the Paris Colonial Exposition to actually matter on a world-wide scale, we're going to need to allow other nations to participate in it; particularly ones with colonial holdings. Hopefully, by doing so, this will become more than diplomatic retaliation against German and Soviet claims, and hopefully will teach the world that there is a clear benefit to Colonialism."
frafla.4.d:0 "The French have provided us with an invite to the Paris Colonial Exposition. The point of this 'festival' of sorts seems to be a political move to change the face of their Colonial Empire, and they hope we also attend for the same purposes. Whilst we could of course attend, it would undoubtedly displease Germany and the Soviets, some nations who were very vocally against the notion of a Paris Colonial Exposition."
frafla.5.d:0 "Finally, after months of preparation; the Paris Colonial Exposition is finally open. Us alongside a handful of nations will finally be able to dismiss any anti-colonialist sentiments by showing them the clear benefits that can be reaped by Colonialism."
frafla.6.d:0 "It seems that the Paris Colonial Exposition has been massively popular, with millions visiting from across the Globe. However, the Hard-left has attempted to capitalize on this opportunity. They've set up their own demonstrations, attempting to portray the 'truth' of the Colonies. Overall, they've been very unsuccessful. Fewer than 10,000 people have actually gone to see these demonstrations out of the millions that have attended the P.C.E."
frafla.7.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has resulted in large amounts of frustration for Workers across France, and a boom in support for the Left. The Syndicalist branch of the SFIO has recently been touring various Factories across France, talking with Workers and encouraging Unionization. Unfortunately, this has culminated in an increase of support for the SFIO, and a small increase in support of the ideology of Syndicalism.\n\nNonetheless, they've garnered a large deal of support within recent time, and their promises to remedy the toil of the working class certainly hasn't been helping us. We might face more resistance in upcoming elections from the SFIO."
frafla.8.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has resulted in large amounts of frustration for Citizens across France, and a boom in support for the Right. It seems that Catholic support for the Action Française has drastically risen over recent weeks, further accelerated by Catholic support for Action Française condemnation of [Root.GetLeader]'s Government for failing to care for France's people without treading on their Faith. \n\nRegardless, they've gathered quite a deal of support from this development, and their promises to right the wrongs of [Root.GetLeader]'s Government hasn't been helping us. We might face more resistance in the upcoming elections from the AF."
frafla.9.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has expectedly resulted in a form of Anglophobic sentiment. Many Frenchmen found themselves further embittered by the British with the culmination of the London Stock Market Crash, and many Frenchmen blame the British for it. Whilst hating the British is not nessecarily abnormal in France, the abnormality comes from an increase in support for the Radical-Right, who also blame the British. \n\n'La perfide Albion' seems to have indirectly fueled a small growth of support for the Radical-Right in France."
frafla.10.d:0 "Thankfully, it seems a multitude of Youth Organizations have come out in support of [Root.GetLeader]'s Government. They've cited that our policies have lead to lessening of the effects of the LSMC, something that the other parties would be incapable of accomplishing. Fortunately, it seems that these Youth Organizations have been capable of convincing many other citizens too; we've found ourselves notably more popular than before."

frafor.1.d:0 "The Entente Army Modernization Plan is intended to bring the various member-states of the Entente up to Modern standards in military affairs. We'll accomplish this by releasing extra funding to these nations, accompanied by sending some French officers if they request."
frafor.2.d:0 "The French have proposed a coordinated Military Modernization plan within the Entente, dubbed the Entente Army Modernization Plan, or simply the EAMP. The French would be willing to fund it for the most part, and even would be willing to send Military Staff to help assist modernization of our armed forces. \n\nWe could accept, or we could decline if we feel our Army is currently up to standards. Alternatively... We could accept, but use the French funds for unrelated use instead of modernizing our armed forces. This, however, would undoubtedly infuriate the French; and it will be unlikely we'll get any future invitations to these plans if we were to pull such a stunt."

Of course, paying these instructors would obviously come out of our own pocket, but the costs would be marginal."
frafor.5.d:0 "Following up on their last plan, France has proposed the Entente Pilot Training Plan (EPTP), focused on teaching our Pilots the elaborate safety routines in order to curtail air accidents. \n\nWe could accept, or we could decline if we feel our Pilots are currently up to standards.

The highlight of this plan is that we're willing to provide funds for any costs in damages which may be induced by this plan, which will hopefully alleviate concerns which would otherwise prevent these training plans from taking place."
frafor.8.d:0 "Following up on their last plan, France has proposed the Entente Naval Exercising Plan (ENEP), focused on naval drills with other members of the Entente, be it us simply observing or participating ourselves.\n\nWe could accept, or we could decline if we feel our Navy is sufficiently experienced. Alternatively... We could accept, but use the French funds for unrelated use instead of for covering damages endured by practice naval drills. This, however, would undoubtedly infuriate the French; and it will be unlikely we'll get any future invitations to these plans if we were to pull such a stunt."

frafor.34.d:0 "Our plan to set a stage for occupation is to first and foremost instigate a crisis in the region, in the particularly nationalist regions of Wallonia. Deforesting the Ardennes would be relatively excusable if we use a guise of it being solely for supply transport, and it'd also inflame nationalist sentiments within Belgium. If we were to instigate any attacks on our personell, we'd be able to force the Belgian government to accept any possible demands without us been seen as (outright) warmongerers."

The signing of the Entente Cordiale had proved that even France and Britain were willing to work together in face of Germany.\n\nThe Great War would break out with horrible casualties for both sides, but none were affected more than France and Britain themselves. The War ended, and disputes between the two powers flared up yet once more. The Entente faded away, and in its place rose the Continental Entente and Imperial Protection Alliance.\n\nWith differences flaring from both former allies, the Franco-British Rivarly will likely escalate unless a decisive factor was to re-unite them out of necessity, similar to the necessity that united them in 1904."

After hours of continued bombing and air campaigns the English would see no option but to be forced out of Portsmouth or have their fleet sunk... But we would have the 2ème Région Navale waiting right outside. Once the survivors attempt to evacuate; they'd be right in the hands of the Marine Nationale. We might be able to seize some ships and put them to use, or simply sink them. /n/n However, this would be done before we declare war; thus we'd be able to catch the English off-guard. There is no doubt that if we were to undertake such a move we'd go down as undisputed Villians in history if we lose the ensuring War; but with an advantage like this... How could we lose?"

To combat this problem the two left parties, the social-democratic PRS and the libertarian socialist SFIO, have decided that it would be best if the PRS, the currently smaller leftist party, to endorse the SFIO to ensure a left wing victory in the coming election."
frapol.1.a:0 "Leftists unifying? They'll split in a few months time."
frapol.2.t:0 "The French 1936 election"
frapol.2.d:0 "After a long period of unrest and protests, the French elections have finally concluded. The elections were full of surprises and newcomers, the radical left represented by the SFIO and the radical right represented by the AF see increased popularity mainly due to the ecopnomic and social issues in France. There are currently two options on the table how to continue, either a left coalition consisting of SFIO, PRS and PR, or a centre-right coalition consisting of FR, ADR and PR. Which of these possible coalitions should be formed in the coming months?"
frapol.2.a:0 "PR, PRS and SFIO will try to form a coalition!"
frapol.2.b:0 "FR, ADR and PR will try to form a coalition!"
frapol.3.t:0 "The Issue of Diplomacy"
frapol.3.d:0 "The first topic of the coalition talks will be diplomacy. The SFIO is strongly against allying with any bourgeois powers and also against any offensive intervention in countries like Germany. The PRS is in a middle-ground, willing to seek alliances with other bourgeois powers but reluctant to take action against Germany if it were to result in another Great War. The PR is a lot more pragmatic, they want to seek allies where necessary and see military intervention as a justifiable last resort. Can a compromise be made?"
frapol.3.a:0 "A case to case basis will be the best option"
frapol.3.b:0 "The SFIO will not listen to this bourgeois rhetoric!"
frapol.4.t:0 "The question of Unions"
frapol.4.d:0 "Unionisation, one of the key issues that have appeared after the election. The people seem to strike more and more and there needs to be a way to solve this. The SFIO & PRS proposes to give the unions whatever they desire, the PR on the other hand, proposes to directly talk to the people themselves and give them what they want. What is the best way to solve this dilemma?"
frapol.4.a:0 "Listen, but succumb to the unions"
frapol.4.b:0 "The SFIO demands unionisation!"
frapol.5.t:0 "The Workweek"
frapol.5.d:0 "Currently France has a fourty hour work week, which equates to eight hours a day, five days a week. The SFIO demand a reduction to thirty hours, seeing as the bourgeois pigs work even less than that, the PR however, thinks this massive reduction suddenly might harm the economy and propose a simple increase in minimum wage to compensate."
frapol.5.a:0 "How about thirty-six hours?"
frapol.5.b:0 "Thirty hours is a must"
frapol.6.t:0 "The question of religion"
frapol.6.d:0 "The 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State removed the privileged status of the state religion. However due to the current issues around the world, people are coming back to christianity for its stability and unity. The FR proposes to endorse this christian movement to both help the population and also hopefully steal some voters from the christian AF, the other two parties however, value religious freedom and propose to keep this freedom."
frapol.6.a:0 "Maybe just endorse some christian values?"
frapol.6.b:0 "The will of god is more important than two puny parties!"
frapol.7.t:0 "The question of Unions"
frapol.7.d:0 "Unionisation, one of the key issues that have appeared after the election. The people seem to strike more and more and there needs to be a way to solve this. The FR and ADR propose to simply outlaw strikes to solve this problem, the PR thinks this is highly limiting the freedom of the individual and thus proposes to simply ignore the strikers."
frapol.7.a:0 "Just tax the unions as a compromise"
frapol.7.b:0 "Striking is crime and must be outlawed, whatever the PR says!"
frapol.8.t:0 "The minimum wage"
frapol.8.d:0 "France does not have a nationwide minimum wage at the moment, the PR has put forward a proposal to introduce a nationwide minimum wage to abolish the large difference between French provinces in minimum wage. The other two parties desire to have no minimum of any kind."
frapol.8.a:0 "No minimum wage for now"
frapol.8.b:0 "The minimum wage is a must for the PR!"
frapol.9.t:0 "PR-PRS-SFIO coalition talks fail!"
frapol.9.d:0 "After months of debating the leaders of the PR, PRS and SFIO have decided that it would be in their and the nation's best interest to stop these coalition talks. The leader said that the gap between the two parties was simply one too big to cross. Now the FR, ADR and PR will try to form a coalition."
frapol.9.a:0 "Best of luck to them!"
frapol.10.t:0 "PR-PRS-SFIO coalition talks succeed!"
frapol.10.d:0 "The coalition talks between the PR, PRS and the SFIO have had a positive outcome, the parties have agreed to a coalition agreement and are expected to be inaugurated in their positions soon. France has another government again!"
frapol.10.a:0 "Hurrah!"
frapol.11.t:0 "FR-ADR-PR coalition talks fail!"
frapol.11.d:0 "AFter several months of intense debate the centre right coalition talks have failed. There were several issues which the parties proclaimed were simply impossible to get an agreement about. France has to go on without a government for a few months more sadly. The SFIO and PR will now try to form a new coalition."
frapol.11.a:0 "Hopefully the leftists are more competent"
frapol.12.t:0 "FR-ADR-PR coalition talks successful"
frapol.12.d:0 "The coalition talks that have been going on in the last few months between the FR, ADR and PR have succeded. This means that France finally has a government again and that the nation will head into the future with a centre-right coalition."
frapol.12.a:0 "Yay"
frapol.13.t:0 "Another coalition talk fails"
frapol.13.d:0 "Coalition talks have failed again. After another few months, the parties could still not agree to any sort of agreement. The people are becoming restless due to the long time the nation has been without a proper government. New elections will be held in a few months time where there will hopefully be a more conclusive result."
frapol.13.a:0 "Long live democracy..."
frapol.14.t:0 "The end of the LSMC"
frapol.14.d:0 "The LSMC has finally ended. After some drastic reforms the economy is growing again and people are getting jobs again. France is finally back on her feet!"
frapol.14.a:0 "It's over"
frapol.15.t:0 "New Elections are called"
frapol.15.d:0 "Due to the faliure of the previous government to form a coalition, new elections have been called."
frapol.15.a:0 "The SFIO wins!"
frapol.15.b:0 "A Grand Coalition against the Extrémistes is formed!"
frapol.15.c:0 "The AF wins!"
