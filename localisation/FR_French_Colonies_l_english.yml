FRA_government_in_exile:0 "Government In Exile"
FRA_government_in_exile_desc:0 "With the fall of Paris our government was forced to escape to our colonial possession of Algiers. From here we can organize and gather strength, far away from the German menace. Sadly not many French soldiers were able to make the journey to North Africa and the locals do not sympathize with our cause, both of which have lead to a severe lack of manpower."

VIN_rural_nation:0 "Rural Colonial State"
VIN_rural_nation_desc:0 "Compared to Europe, [Root.GetName] is a very poor and rural region. Most people here survive on subsistence farming. Our policies can only be effectively enforced on major population centers which has lead to a severe lack of manpower. [Root.GetName]'s hot and humid climate also scares many investors from bringing industry to our nation which forces us to be very dependant on France."

VIN_socialist_revolutionaries:0 "Saigon Association"
VIN_socialist_revolutionaries_desc:0 "The Saigon Association is an Anarcho-Syndicalist organization of revolutionaries that continue to hamper with our Administration by carrying out attacks on notable French industries. This has both hurt production and caused investor confidence to evaporate."

NFA_pacification_of_africa:0 "Pacification of West Africa"
NFA_pacification_of_africa_desc:0 "In order to make West Africa more 'accommodative' for the French, this colony has embarked on a mission of 'pacifying' the local populace. Regular military expeditions into the colonies to quell resistance, protection of trade personnel and entrepreneurs, and interning persons suspected of revolt have resulted in more stability and investor confidence for the colony, but has inversely hurt our relationship with the natives."

MOR_harsh_environment:0 "Harsh Environment"
MOR_harsh_environment_desc:0 "Generally hot, arid, and not suited for industrial expansion, investors refuse to assist colonial development of French North Africa. Our scientists seek to prove these investors wrong. By using flasks, beakers, and making shit up out of nowhere, they might be able to conjure up a 'study' that proves these investors incorrect. How long until it arrives is unknown though."

NFQ_colonial_unrest:0 "Native Unrest"
NFQ_colonial_unrest_desc:0 "Poor living conditions, lack of infrastructure and economic stagnation has caused Native Unrest to flare within our colony. Whilst our government actively works to correct these issues, it's undoubtedly going to be some time until the issue is resolved."
