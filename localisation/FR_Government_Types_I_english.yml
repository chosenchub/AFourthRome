internationalist_subtype_desc:0 "Developed from particularly interventionist branches of Collectivism and Marxism overall, Internationalist Socialism, as it calls itself, or more commonly known as Internationalism,  is a socialist ideology that proposes the workers, once in power, must organize to enact a perpetual revolution, and to continue proactively in their struggle to bring socialism to the world. While most socialist strains are of international nature, the proactive spirit of Internationalism has given it a more militant nature, and Internationalist ideologues are known advocates of increased militarization of the workers in name of the revolution, as well as establishing a strong state that is able to defend the workers’ interests and protect the revolution from reactionary forces that may oppose it, however, these traits are just means, not ends, to Internationalists' agenda, as the revolution is never supposed to stop spreading."

vanguardist_subtype_desc:0 "One of the most extreme and divisive branches of Socialism, as well as an umbrella term for those ideologies that operate in similar systems, Vanguard Socialism, or Vanguardism, is a political idea that proposes the establishment of a strong socialist state, with total control over society, lead by a political vanguard group, to direct the working classes towards the Marxist dream. Widely considered revisionist, nowadays, any socialist ideologies that propose structures such as a strong state, leadership, and military tend to be categorized under Vanguardism as an umbrella term too."
###
collectivist_subtype_desc:0 "Collectivism proper, commonly referred to as Revolutionary Collectivism, is a socialist ideology that proposes the implementation of an order of mutual co-dependence and of a collectivized society through a socialist state, that in its government apparatus has entities that direct and guide the collective society in its development, but the means of production are essentially owned by the working class. Collectivism often defends slight democratic means of participation of the proletariat, albeit only as long as it doesn’t affect the state’s conduction of the collective, or the implementation of socialism in the collectivist society."
###
libertarian_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "An ideology consisting of many branches, Libertarian Socialism focuses on improving the rights of workers by weakening or eliminating a strong central government and implementing market socialist policies. Additional interpretations can focus on the building of small workers’ communes through the workplace, unions, or collectives or communes, as well as pacifist or radical sects that may focus on the rights of workers in a communal federation or the dismantling of other capitalist states respectively."
###
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanize it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being is the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status"
###
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market Liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of Market Liberalism are an unregulated free market and a liberal democratic political system. Market Liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
###
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology which can vary greatly depending on the political history of the region or nation. Nonetheless, it is normally centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Most conservative societies usually promote a regulated market economy and favour economic protectionism."
###
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian Democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues, favour centralization and typically have Hawkish sentiments in-government; although isolationist branches of this ideology are not unheard of. The aim of these regimes is to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
###
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
###
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Diplomatically, National Populists typically emphasize Expansionist, Hawkish, and Revanchist policies when appropriate or relevant to the nation in question. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."
###
valkist_subtype_desc:0 "Named after the Germanic symbol that German Valkists wear, Valkism is an extreme nationalist and militaristic ideology, that proposes a system where the political power is centralized under a strong leadership, that through the state controls and guides the nation to its national rebirth. Nonetheless, Valkists fundamentally defend socially progressive ideals and the leader grants liberties to the people. Valkists are characterized by adopting conceptual and aesthetical aspects from ancient, pagan, mystical and esoterical traditions, generally relevant to the nation in question. There are many schools of thought in Valkist economics, but the state supremacy and control over it is undisputed."
