hungary.1.t:0 "The Status of Hungary"
hungary.1.d:0 "At the dawn of the Great War, Hungary made up the transleithanian half of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and enjoyed significant autonomy within the Empire. While the Austrian army was constantly fighting in Galicia and Italy on the front lines, the Hungarian army was relegated to border defense and garrison duties. When the Austo-Hungarian Empire's demise was near, the Hungarian parliment voted in vast majority to secede from Austria and align itself with the Entente under the promise that its territorial integrety would not be breached. The Austrian Empire collapsed three days later, and Hungarys future seemed secure. \n\nBut the Hungarian army was in shambles, and in a moment of weakness the Soviet-backed collectivist Béla Kun stormed Budapest with his red militia and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Franco-Serbian soldiers, along with Romanians and Czechoslovaks quickly invaded and exiled Béla Kun to Russia. When the Prime Minister of Hungary, Mihály Károlyi, asked the Entente to recall its armies, he was instead declared an enemy of the Entente and forced to sign a humiliating treaty that would see the Hungarian nation carved up between Serbia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia through a series of secret deals that were made between 1914 and 1916. The Hungarian people have not forgotten this betrayal to this day, and some groups are actively seeking to reclaim the lands ripped from them fifteen years ago. \n\nThe future of Hungary is uncertian, and their fate is unknown. What is known is that the events which unfold in Carpathia may determine the fate of the entire Balkan peninsula..."

Thankfully, several economic paths were pre-planned for a market crash, just not of this scale.

Karolyi, Kun, and Horthy all sit at a round table, making small talk, cracking jokes, and drinking fine wine. As the night drags on, little progress is made, until Karolyi speaks up. 'gentlemen, as much as we all enjoy this meeting, we must get down to buisness.' Both Kun and Horthy agree, this crisis cannot wait any longer. Both Kun and Horthy present their demands, each effectivly wanting control of the nation.\n\nAfter further hours of discussions and negotiations, Karolyi has finally come to a conclusion..."

### Crisis prelude 1 ###

hungary.11.t:0 "Red Militia rallies in Kosice!"
hungary.11.d:0 "The Red Milita has been dispersed across Hungary ever since their creation. However, our scouts are reporting a large concentration of Red Army forces around the city of Kosice in South Slovakia. The men have set up camp only a few miles out of the city, and the garrison fears an attack on the city at any moment. It would appear that Bela Kun is consolidating his power, and if he isn't stopped soon he may attempt to take control of the nation."
hungary.11.a:0 "Perhaps inaction is not the solution..."

### Crisis prelude 2 ###

hungary.12.t:0 "Blackshirts kidnap government official!"
hungary.12.d:0 "In the early hours of the day, a group of men loyal to the Horthyiest cause managed to break into the home of a government official and take him hostage. This dreadful news leaves us with a most awful choice to make. We can accept the ransom demands and concede to these terrorists, or remade resolute and stoic in the face of pressure. Neither of these options are particularly good, but what other choice do we have?"
hungary.12.a:0 "We do not negotiate with terrorists..."
hungary.12.b:0 "We will accept the reasonable demands..."

### Crisis prelude 3 ###

hungary.13.t:0 "Red Militia parades in Kosice"
hungary.13.d:0 "The Red Militia has been entrenched outside of Kosice for exactly a full year, and yesterday they decided to finally enter the city in a so-called 'peaceful demonstration'. The city seemed to accept the militia with open arms, despite what we had expected. Even the garrison layed down their arms in the presence of the red flag. For a while it seemed that the city would be the birthplace of the Second Hungarian Soviet Republic, but late in the day, the militia left the city without leaving as much as a trace, and we have lost their whereabouts for the time being."
hungary.13.a:0 "It's a mob of angry socialists, how could we lose track of them?"

### Crisis prelude 4 ###

hungary.14.t:0 "Blackshirts and Red Militia clash in Pecs"
hungary.14.d:0 "Citizens of the city of Pecs were awoken earlier today to thunderous shocks coming from outside the city. The local garrison reported two large groups of people shooting at each other in a field just outside the city. As the day progressed, the fighting grew in magnitide and size, until the Blackshirts took the initiative and stormed the western outskirts of the city. While the fighting continued long into the evening, it ended in a stalemate with both sides claiming victory over the other. Many civilians were harmed and killed, and the fighting damaged several roads and buildings. These actions cannot be allowed to continue, and these two madmen must be brought to justice."
hungary.14.a:0 "We have stalled long enough..."

### Buying French Artillery ###

hungary.15.t:0 "Offer to purchase French guns"
hungary.15.d:0 "The Treaty of Annecy may have banned us from holding more than 5,000 artillery pieces, but perhaps we can cirvumvent this buy offering to buy French guns for a lump sum. Granted, our neighbors will not be pleased by this, and it may sour relations past the breaking point."
hungary.15.a:0 "Send the offer!"

### France accepts artillery offer ###

hungary.16.t:0 "France accepts our offer!"
hungary.16.d:0 "The French have agreed to sell us their artillery, in direct defiance of the Treaty of Annecy which they themselves dictated upon us. Perhaps this is a sign that the Treaty can be disregarded, or at the very least taken with less authority."
hungary.16.a:0 "Let us hope we never have to use their own guns against them..."

### France declines artillery offer ###

hungary.17.t:0 "France declines our offer."
hungary.17.d:0 "Sadly, the French have declined our offer to purchase their old guns, and have followed up with a stern warning that a continued policy of rearmament will be met with harsh consiquences. We must tread careully if we are to avoid a repeat of the Great War."
hungary.17.a:0 "Maybe we can buy some Mongol rifles with the money instead..."

hungary.18.t:0 "We have been allowed into the Continential Entente"
hungary.18.d:0 "The French delegation has arrived, and has informed us that the French have accepted our request to be allowed into the Continential Entente! This is a momentous occasion for all of Hungary, and we have surely secured our future.

hungary.18.a:0 "Can we import baguettes now?"

### France declines CE request ###

hungary.19.t:0 "France has not let us into the Continental Entente."
hungary.19.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, the French have formally declined our request to join the Continental Entente. Despite the growing tensions across Europe, the French have apperently found it in their best interests to seclude us, and bar us from their alliance. This is a dark day for our nation, and we have been left in a most vunerable position."
hungary.19.a:0 "Perhaps the British will be kinder..."

enghun.1.t:0 "Hungary proposes joint research project"
enghun.1.d:0 "Diplomats from Hungary have approached us today with a proposal. They wish to combine the efforts of Oxford University with that of their own university in Budapest. While Oxford is leagues above Budapest in terms of acedamia, this may serve as a prime oppertunity to bring Hungary into our sphere of influence. Having an ally on the continent would prove useful the Germans or French ever decide to act up, but it may also only serve to hinder us and act as a burden. How shall we respond?"
enghun.1.a:0 "An exellant proposal!"
enghun.1.b:0 "We will make no deal with the Magyars."

### England acceps ###

hungary.19.d:0 "In an official letter from Oxford Univeristy, our proposal for a joint-research project has been accepted! We will send students over to England at once to jump-start this project, and we will be reaping the benifits within weeks."
hungary.19.a:0 "This will draw us closer to Britain."

### England declines ###

hungary.20.t:0 "Oxford declines our proposal."
hungary.20.d:0 "Unfortunitly, Oxford University sent us a letter earlier today stating that they do not wish for us to partake in their research. This has harmed our relations with the British, and our chances of joining the Imperial Protection Alliance have dwindled greatly because of it."
hungary.20.a:0 "This is most unfortunate."

hungary.25.t:0 "The United Kingdom allows us into the IPA!"
hungary.25.d:0 "Wonderful knews from London. The government of the United Kingdom has allowed us into the Imperial Protection Alliance!

hungary.25.a:0 "God save the King!"

### England declines IPA request ###

hungary.26.t:0 "The United Kingdom has barred us from the IPA."
hungary.26.d:0 "In a statement directly from Buckingham Palace, the United Kingdom has declined our request to join the IPA. We must look elsewhere for allies, and watch our backs for enemies who may wish to carve us up in our moment of weakness."

hungary.27.t:0 "Horthy storms the capital!"
hungary.27.d:0 "After weeks of silence, many thought the Blackshirts had faded back into obscurity, but today that has been proven wrong. In the early hours of the morning, several blocks within Budapest lit up with gunfire as Blackshirts poured onto the street and pushed the local garrison back into the town center. The fighting was savage, as men fought for individual buildings and rooms, but eventually the Blackshirts managed to overwhelm the garrison and seize complete control over the city. Mihaly karolyi was personally dragged out onto the street where he was confronted by Horthy himself. After a long and empowering speech, Karolyi was executed and his body hung for all of Budapest to see. Horthy is in control of Hungary now, and many are watching closely to see what the madman does next..."
