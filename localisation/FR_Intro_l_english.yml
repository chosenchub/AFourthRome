intro.1.d:0 "After Months of blood, toil, tears and sweat; the Führerreich team finally has released the Führerreich mod for Hearts of Iron 4! For over 7 months, we've been working on this mod, working to bring an enjoyable product to the community. We're constantly attempting to improve and hold ourselves to similar standards that other mods (such as Kaiserreich) follow. However, we're far from finished, which brings us to our next point.\n\nKeep in mind, Führerreich is in Alpha at the moment, and is heavily in development and worldbuilding. As such, it's to be expected that various irritants such as bugs or crashes may crop up in playthroughs. If you come across any, please report them to us! However, keep in mind, if you're playing Fuhrerreich with other mods enabled; that's a likely cause for any Crashes or Bugs you may come across. Nonetheless, play it safe and be sure to submit a bug report.\n\n Without further ado, enjoy!"
intro.2.d:0 "Q; (Nation) is pretty bad. Will it be getting a rework?\nA; Yes, all nations are intended to get a rework at some point in time. Nothing here is permanent.\n\nQ; Will (Nation) get content in the future?\nA; Our goal, similar to Kaiserreich, is for all nations to eventually recieve content. Now, the time until that's accomplished? You can bet it's going to be quite some time; we're only human after all.\n\nQ; Will DLCs (such as WtT) be a requirement for Fuhrerreich?\nA; Absolutely not. While Fuhrerreich will make good use of the new features added in official expansions we will not make it mandatory for Players to buy the DLCs to play the mod.\n\nQ;I'd like to join the team as an Artist/Coder/Tester! Where do I sign up?\nA; Great to hear! You'll have to join our Discord Server and fill out the respective application. We've got links to the discord on our Steam Workshop page and Subreddit, however if you're a masochist and would prefer to type the invite out manually; it's right here: https://discord.gg/7Q6VuRN"
intro.3.d:0 "Fuhrerreich uses Kaiserreich's minister system, and obviously borrows from KR heavily in multiple other areas. One such example is the popularity system. \n\nKaiserreich's popularity system entails more notable Political Power gain for nations that have more popular parties, in an attempt to represent civil content with the regime or parliamentary majorities in democratic systems. Generally, higher popularity means that PP Gain will also be higher. The following is the Criteria for the various popularity levels. \n\nVery Low Popularity = Less than 20% Popularity for the ruling Party\nLow Popularity = 20% - 40% Popularity for the ruling Party\nMedium Popularity = 40% - 60% Popularity for the ruling Party\nHigh Popularity = 60% - 80% Popularity for the ruling Party\nVery High Popularity = More than 80% Popularity for the ruling Party\n\nNow, we said 'Generally, higher popularity means that PP Gain will also be higher' for a reason. Nations such as France have their popularity system disabled in order to properly simulate their coalition-based gameplay (or for other reasons entirely). Just be sure to keep this in mind and you should be smooth-sailing when playing nations with their party popularity system disabled!"
intro.4.d:0 "Hello there! Similar to Kaiserreich, the world of Fuhrerreich relies heavily on news events in order to feel alive and interesting. Ultimately, there's the possibility that you may not apperciate this though, and would prefer to turn it off to reduce event-spam.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned reasons, we're going to need you to select a preference for World News events before we let you out of this event chain."
