ITA_FUHRERREICH_DESC: "Italy emerged from the Great War as a new nation, nearly doubling her land and recovering the Terre Irredente. But after the war the situation wasn't so good, the war led to the crash of the economy and to workers' strikes erupting in civil disorder. Chaos continued until 1923 when poet d'Annunzio tried to coup the government but failed. After those troubles, an Austerity Government was formed and the King Abdicated. Today Italy is nearly stable, but the winds of change that are affecting the world might strike at any moment..."

italy.0.t:0 "The Italian Kingdom"
italy.0.d:0 "After winning the Great War, Italy, had regained the long dreamed Terre Irredente of Dalmatia, Trentino, and Istria, plus some colonial concessions. Although the war was a diplomatic success, the same thing can't be said about the economic situation. The Italian economy wasn't ready for the war and the military industry wasn't developed enough, so during the first year of conflict, thousands of people fought with only feather caps and knives, the government realised the situation was horrible so a lot of factories were shut down and then transformed into ammo- and rifle factories. So, when the war was over and the workers returned to the factories there was no work. People were also promised money for fighting in the war, but those were never received by the soldiers. In this climate of anger and delusion workers decided to take their opportunity and occupy the factories. The 'Biennio' Rosso had started. In reaction to this attempted revolution, squads of Great War veterans and nationalists in general formed up to fight the red menace, workers occupied and held good chunks of land until 1923, when the pro-government and nationalists forces succeeded in taking it. Following the glory, war veteran, poet, and writer D'Annunzio, who led the squads until that moment, decided it was the moment to overthrow the monarchy, thousands of Legionnaires stormed all the major cities of Italy, failing in some and succeeding in others, while the main group entered the parliament, the action was stopped by the Regio Esercito and D'Annunzio arranged a flight to Fiume, were he had an established headquarter and tried another time but he was instantly chased off by the local police platoon. In the following days all the conspiracy theorists were arrested and an austerity government called. The austerity government headed by Ivanoe Bonomi, started a number of reforms, starting with the concession of workers' rights and ending with a reform of the judiciary system and thus the amnesty for all the Legionnaires and Revolutionairies that fought between 1921-1923 during the Biennium. In 1926, liberal King Vittorio Emanuele III, deluded of the end of his reign, feeling guilty of the chaotic Biennium and scared of a comeback of the communists, abdicated in favour of his son, Umberto II di Savoia. Today, Italy has almost recovered, but major change on a global scale could revive one decade old memories and anger the far-left opposition, that has been still strong to this day.... \n\nJumping to 1936, liberals, now led by Luigi Einaudi, still remain the largest party in parliament but not a majority. Their government is unpopular and unable to get much done. The 1936 parliamentary election is looking to be one of the most defining in Italian history. The liberals are opposed by three other coalitions. The centre-left social democrats, the christian conservatives and the far-left communists. While it looks like the social democrats have the best chance of gaining a majority against the liberals, in a quickly changing world it could be anyone's race"
italy.0.a:0 "Fides Est Regni Tutela"
italy.1.t:0 "The XXIX Italian Legislature"
italy.1.d:0 "Election time has finally come again. The previous Liberal government has recovered from the disaster of the Red Biennium and has become a mainstay in Italian politics. Despite this leftist sentiments have become increasingly popular among the citizens and within parliament. This Election is expected to be an intense fight between the Unione Socialista coalition led by the Social Democrat candidate Giuseppe Saragat and between the Liberal party led by current president of the council Luigi Einaudi, but in the wake of the LSMC a comeback for the more extreme factions in Italian politics, the leftist Partito Socialista or the right wing Partito Popolare is quite possible."
italy.1.a:0 "Let the fight begin!"
italy.2.t:0 "The Foreign Policy question"
italy.2.d:0 "The first issue brought up in Parliament is the direction of our foreign policy. Former member of the Partito Popolare, Alcide de Gasperi, argued that Italy should pursue a closer relation with members of the Entente, especially with our Latin sister France. Palmiro Togliatti of the Communist Party alternatively stated that the Italian nation should leave the reactionary Entente and instead should align itself with the Soviet Union however his statement was not supported by the more moderate Socialist party or by the Social Democratic Party. The Liberals remained silent on the foreign affairs and preferred to talk on more relevant topic like the economy."
italy.2.a:0 "The USSR is the core of the Revolution, we should support them."
italy.2.b:0 "The Liberals are right, We should focus on domestic affairs first."
italy.2.c:0 "Togliatti is a fool, but he isn't completely wrong..."
italy.2.e:0 "De Gasperi is right, we should support the Entente."
italy.3.t:0 "The Suffragette question"
italy.3.d:0 "During the socialist government of Ivanoe Bonomi various reforms led to women gaining the right to vote, but little more. Today the first Italian woman deputy, Lina Merlin, a member of the socialist party spoke for total equality. The Socialist applauded her speech, while the more conservative elements of the Italian parliament were shocked by her shameless prepotency."
italy.3.a:0 "Applaud her effort! Women are a cornerstone of the Revolution."
italy.3.b:0 "Interesting but she's too radical."
italy.3.c:0 "Commend her effort! We must always consider the perspective of Women."
italy.3.e:0 "Politics is no place for a woman."
italy.4.t:0 "Internal Policy"
italy.4.d:0 "In the last few years southern Italy and Sicily has seen a sharp rise in organised crime. Parliament is now forced to consider substantial reforms. Don Luigi Sturzo, leader of Partito Popolare and a Sicilian himself, suggested that an increase in funding and a statute giving Sicily more autonomy would help the island region fight the Crime Families. The democratic socialist party wishes to pursue a broader goal of decentralization for the regions of Italy. The Communist suggested to create Anti-Mafia militias squad to protect the people. The Liberals preferred to maintain the status quo but promised to fight organized crime."
italy.4.a:0 "The Militia would wipe out all those Mafia scum!"
italy.4.b:0 "The current policies are working fine"
italy.4.c:0 "Decentralization is necessary for a state like Italy."
italy.4.e:0 "Luigi Sturzo has good ideas."
italy.5.t:0 "Economic reforms"
italy.5.d:0 "After the Great War, Italy faced an economic depression and became deeply buried in debt. The previous government was achieving a slow recovery but with the new global crisis started by the LSMC the Italian economy found itself again on the brink of collapse. The leftist coalition is trying to push for the creation of a welfare state or "Stato Sociale". The Communist of course are pushing for collectivization and the redistribution of the means of production. Liberals and Conservatives both support mild state intervention only if needed."
italy.5.a:0 "We must seize the means of production!"
italy.5.b:0 "The economy is recovering fine"
italy.5.c:0 "A welfare state would be the favorable option"

This has not stopped many on the right from protesting against the party though. Many are worried that this is the end of Italian democracy as we know it and some even claim that a one party Communist state is right around the corner. Antonio Gramsci's connections to the Soviet Union have not helped calm these fears. While it would be hypocritical for us to deny the communist their democratic victory sometimes scrafices must be made for the greater good"

Now that the military has seized control some leaders like Luigi Capello, a hero of the Great War, suggest a quick restoration of a civillian government while Pietro Badoglio instead proposed to invite the third duke of Savoy-Aosta, Amedeo, to become head of state but rumors are rampant that Italo Balbo may use his new found influence to proclaim himself dictator or "Duce" of Italy."

The Turks and their Libyan allies withdrew to the countryside instead of surrendering, and the Italians bombarded the cities for three days, and then proclaimed the Tripolitanians to be 'committed and strongly bound to Italy'. This marked the beginning of a series of battles between the Italian colonial forces and the Libyan armed opposition in the East of Libya. From this Chaos, Senussi Fighter, Omar Mukhtar arose as a leader of the resistance and figurehead for all lybians. Mukhtar was a skilled tactician and good strategist, but our soldiers finally captured him earlier this morning after a raid in his house.

italy.53.d:0 "20 years ago as the Great War was coming to a close many Communist chose to undermine the stability of Italy. The war had weakened our nation's economy and in response many unions initiated strikes. While the 'Worker's Councils' claim these strikes had the goal of improving the living standards of the average worker it was clear they were inspired by the revolution in Russia and were willing to do anything to bring Communism to our country. This unrest severely weakened Italy and the ruling government was too feeble to effectively respond. Under the leadership of National Syndicalist and Great War veteran Benito Mussolini, who until 1921 fought alongside the Workers, legions of patriots known as 'Black Shirts' took to the streets of Italy to fight back against the wave of insurrection, from both left and right. Mussolini believed that the Nation shouldn't have fallen neither to the Communist Beasts, that would have let the nation become a Satelite of the USSR, neither to the reactionairies, that would have weakened the Nation with their ideas. This violence was successful in many cases but it was not without its causalities. In 1925 Mussolini was shot and killed by a communist sympathizer while leading his followers to break up a Union protest . This severely weakened the Black Shirt, that without Mussolini started to align itself with D'Annunzio's Squads,  in 1926 the Liberal government ended the compromise and of the Black Shirts there was nothing left. Mussolini's impressive oratory skills and 'strongman' philosophy had inspired many especially Il Duce Italo Balbo who's government is highly built upon his rhetoric. We must remember Benito Mussolini for being a Forefather of the modern, stronger, Latin nation."

After the war d'Annunzio's new found influence and well-spoken arguments for the irredentist cause was a defining factor in securing the Third Shore for it's rightful owner. During the Red Biennium, D'Annunyio, unfortunately, became famous for his failed Coup D'Etat against the monarchy, in 1923, that let the country fall into chaos. His supporters now use his funeral as an occasion to celebrate the heroes who fought in the Great War to make Italy a truly formidable world power and ask for the repatriation of the body of the Vate from Brazil."

As the war came to a close an economic depression hit Italy. Returning veterans who were forced to leave behind their civilian life returned to a nation unable to support them. In solidarity the Communist and Unions initiated strikes to pressure business and the government into enacting reforms to help the returning workers. Throughout the early 1920s many reactionaries fought against our demonstrations but the Communist cause to help the workers persevered until 1926 when an agreeable compromise was met between the Left and the ruling Centrist Liberals. In the wake of the LSMC though many more have drifted to the Communist party which allowed us to secure victory in the 1936 Election.

italy.57.d:0 "The “Regio Esercito Italiano” has been the National Army since the foundation of the kingdom and it has taken part in all the Italian conflicts. During the Great War 5 million soldiers were part of the army, but the number has decreased since then and the new tactics we have learned during the war could help modernize our army. The spirit of the Duke of Victory Armando Diaz, whom passed away in 1928, is still living strong in the army and thanks to him Italian soldiers are no longer under equipped but this has also lead to complacency within the commanding officers which may weaken are ability to defend ourselves. Earlier attempts at modernization began when Italy started purchasing tanks from Britain in 1928 which has helped the Italian war industry advance quite significantly. FIAT is pushing for the implementation of newer, home built, tanks into the army so we can spare our soldiers the unprotected slaughter they were subjected to in the Great War but some officers believe that the one major reason for the Italian army's poor performance in that war was due to the lack of sufficient artillery. Instead of focusing on expensive and vulnerable tanks they think we should make sure our soldiers have advanced and powerful artillery to support their attacks. In Rome, collectivist politicians have influenced some army leaders to integrate the paramilitary/partisan Red Brigades into the army and push for the implementation of mass conscription and partisan warfare while the more conservative elements of parliament wish to give more autonomy to officers and generals who wish to create a strong, well trained and well equiped professional army spearheaded by powerful “Alpini” mountaineer divisions who are a great source of pride for the Italian Nation."

italy.58.d:0 "After the LSMC the Italian Economy found itself in a state similar to the crisis that preceded the Red Biennium. Now if we want to recover quick and not fall to another Red revolution we must decide where and how to develop our industry. The natural options are the rural south and our new acquisitions such as Dalmatia. The southern regions or “Mezzogiorno” have a long history of being culturally and economically separated from the North. The south was once a monarchy ruled by a Bourbon, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which in 1861 fell under Savoyard occupation during the Italian Risorgimento. During the first year of integration a concept of Piedmontisation was established in the whole Italian peninsula. Most politicians never cared much of the southern region and instead developed the North, that led to the creation of crime organizations like Cosa Nostra or 'Ndrangheta and to a lower standard of living than compared to Northern Italy. A new economic program centered on the "Mezzogiorno" will pacify the harsh relations with the local population but could lead to a "war" with the crime's families that are in control of rural Sicily.Dalmatia has only been Italian since the end of the Great War, before then it was Austrian, Venetian and Croatian. Dalmatia is the long-lost land symbol of Italian Nationalism and Austrian greed. Poets like Gabriele D'Annunzio talked about the beauty of that land and even Dante recognized it as the frontier of the Italian State. Hundreds of thousands of Soldiers died for this land and now that it's in the right hands we should bring it back to their golden age during the Venetian era. Since the acquisition of the region by the Austrians under the Treaty of Campoformio the area has been severly ignored. Moving the Italian economic center to this region could favor immigration to the coast and the development of the new ports like the pearl of Dalmatia, Ragusa or the rose of the Adriatic, Trieste."

Debates over Abanian autonomy have raged on for years but now it seems Rome has plans to settle the issue for good. Italy has officially announced Albania as the newest Region of the kingdom and will administer it as such. This announcement has recived mixed support in our own government however. Many Italian buisness men support the annexation caliming it would help develop our rural nation's economy but many nationalists still remember the sacrifices of the Albanians who fought against the Ottomans only 30 years ago. Never again should we fall under the boot of a foreign power."
italy.95.d:0 "Ever since the Great War concluded the foreign policy of Albania has been handled by Rome. Now though Italy has offered to promote our nation to become an official member of the Entente, giving us a sway in there policies. While this would bring us much pretige and influence many of our ministers still prefer to seek a neutral foreign policy."
italy.952.d:0 "Albania has agreed to join the Entente as an official participating member, gaining the influence and reposibility that comes along with it."
italy.953.d:0 "Albania has choosen to continue there neutral foreign policy. We will continue to offer protection to there nation despite this."
italy.96.d:0 "The recent coup in Rome has brought Italo Balbo, a strong visionary nationalist, to power. His goal and philosophy matches ours very well to the point that he has offered an alliance with our nation to help unite Spain. In troubled times like this those with strength and goals must unite to see there destiny achieved but many conservative officials argue that Balbo is taking advantage of our weakness to gain influence over the politics of Spain."
italy.962.d:0 "The Falangist have accepted our propsal for an alliance. Our armies are already preparing to land in Spain and support the Falangist war effort."
italy.97.d:0 "The blind politicians in Falangist Spain have refused our alliance. If we truly want influence of Spain however we shouldn't waste time supporting a weak regime, we should directly intevene and bring the glory of Roman arms to the Spanish nation."
italy.98.d:0 "The government of Rome has sent us an ultimatum demanding that we submit to there foreign policy goals. In return Italy will provide us protection and economic support. This demand has been rejected by many ministers in our government as an obvious attack against our sovereignty but some anti-British politicians argue that our two mediterranean nations share similar goals and interests and that together we can rid ourselves of harmful British influence."
italy.982.d:0 "With the backing of Italy the government of Greece has annuled the London Naval Treaty. They have already dismissed many British nationals from there country. Despite our support for there nation in the Great War it seems that the Greeks are now choosing to distance themselves from us. Italy has been a thorn in our side for years now. We must fight any more attempts to from the Italians to usurp our influence in the Mediterranean."
italy.99.d:0 "The Greek foreign minister has dismissed our ultimatum and has reafirmed it's support for the United Kingdom. Clearly no peaceful union of our states can occur under these circumstances. We may have to intervene directly into Greece to spread our influence but we must be wary of any possible British reaction to this."
italy.100.d:0 "Italy has been paramount in our unification of Spain. Thousands of Italians and Spanish fought together to help secure our nation but now Rome seeks repayment for it's involvement. They demand we transfer the Balearic Islands to them. These islands hold great strategic importance and are key for control of the Medditereanan. We should keep this in mind before we make a final decision."
italy.101.d:0 "Despite our support for there cause, The Falangist regime refuses to give us a fare repayment. The Balearic will remain Spanish and we will need to look for other bases if we are to continue expanding our influence in the Mediterranean."
italy.102.d:0 "To repay us for our support of their cause, the Falangist regime has agreed to transfer over the Balearic Islands. This will allow us to better protect our nations from any Medditereanan threat."
italy.103.d:0 "Italy has offered to accept us into the Entente Cordial. Many anti-British politicians see this as a great oportunity to rid our nation of British influence but many others are skeptical of Italy and Framce's ability to protect our nation."
italy.1032.d:0 "After days of negotiantions the government in Athens has agreed to join the Entente. With the gorowing threat of Germany looking to consume most of Europe, unity between our fellow democracies is desperatly needed."
italy.104.d:0 "Greece has refused to join the Entente, instead preferring to maintain there relationship with the British. Our attempt to spread Entente influence into the Meddetereanan was clearly misguided."
italy.105.d:0 "Italy, the main power of the Meddetereanan, has demanded control over the Suez Canal and various other ports in the region. Conflict over Italian and British influence in the Meddetereanan have been growing for decades but now it seems that Italy is looking to settle the issue at any cost. The Royal Navy has many commitments across the globe and and our current Meddetereanan Fleet is unprepared for a conflict against the Italian Navy. It will take weeks to organize a dfense against Italy which we may not have. Surrenderring these mostly insignificant territories may save the rest of our Meddetereanan positions."
italy.106.d:0 "To many it seemed that war between Britian and Italy was unavoidable but today both sides have made a peaceful agrrement. The United Kingdom will transfer sovereignty of the Suez canal and several other naval bases to the Kingdom of Italy. Though this move was hugely unpopular with the some in Britian, many more are releaved to see there nation remain at peace. \n\nIn Rome the people cheer on as Il Duce Italo Balbo gives a speech declaring victory over the cowardly British."
italy.107.d:0 "The United Kingdom has refused our demands. Currently our position in the Meddetereanan is stronger than Britian's but we must act fast to secure this. Quick strikes one Gibraltor and Suez would bring this conflict to a quick end but failiure to do so could drag this into a brutal and prolonged war."
italy.108.d:0 "Our war with Italy has been one set back after another. It has become clear to most within the British High Command that a victory against the Italian Army is unlikly. Many ministers have demanded that our nation seeks peace with Italy but such a loss of prestige could jeprodize our entire global empire."
italy.109.d:0 "The United Kingdom has come to us to sue for peace. They are willing to end this conflict on terms that completly surpass our original ones. Not only would we recieve our Meddetereanan ports but also Egypt aswell as British possesions in the middle east."
italy.110.d:0 "Despite our generous offer to Italy, Rome has refused our consessions for peace. We must now use the strength of our entire empire to overcome Italy."
italy.111.d:0 "History repeats itself once again as Italy demands that we submit to there authority. Under the Itlain ultimatum we would become a protectorate within the Italin Empire. While some argue that Italy could help modernize our nation this sentiment is not popular with most of our citisens. Despite the seemingly overwhelming stregth of Italy we will push back any attempt on our sovereignty."
italy.112.d:0 "It was wishful thinking to expect Abyssinia to just surrednder through ultimatum alone. Addis Ababa has ignored our words and now must be persuaded on the battlefield. We shall avenge our previous failiure and secure our position in East Africa."
italy.113.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events our delegates in Addis Ababa have reported that the government of Haile Selassie has agreed to become our protectorate. This will expand our influence in East Africa while also providning economic development to Ethiopia."
italy.114.d:0 "Our comrades in Italy have recently been elected as a majority in the Italian Parliament. With the government under there control they now seek to help secure the liberation of the Spanish worker. They seek to form an official alliance with our movement to help spread the Revolution. While this help us win the war some polititions worry that we may become too dependant on Italy for survival."
italy.115.d:0 "Deespite our generous offer to help liberate the workers of Spain, The Popular Front refuses to sign any official allaince with us. If they wish to die fighting alone, so be it."
italy.116.d:0 "Fellow collectivists in Italy have recently gained controlled of the government. They now seek official solidarity between the Socialist nations of Europe. An alliance between our nations would help protect the socialists socities we have created from the threat of reactionary arms while also securing our access to the mediterranean. Despite these positives though our government has several ideological disagremment with Gramsci's movement and from a pragmatic point of view our two nations are very far apart and isolated from each other making serious cooperation difficult."
italy.117.d:0 "In Moscow and Rome crowds cheer as the news is made public. Italy has joined the Third International, brigning a new era of solidarity between Italian and Russian workers."
italy.118.d:0 "The revisionists in Moscow hve refused our entry into the Third International. Now it seems that we must forge our own path towards the global liberation of the worker."
italy.119.d:0 "Panfilia has been part of the Italian Empire since the end of The Great War but in the face of this global economic depression we must tighten our belts. It has been decided that our territory in Anatolia may not be worth further investment and should be sold to save on any further loses. Now we must decide who to sell this land too though. On one hand the Greece was our ally in the Great War but the nation now has become overextended and may even soon become a threat to us. On the other hand The Ottoman Empire, despite being our enemy in the war, will surely want this land back for it is mostly inhabited by ethnic Turks and would provide access to the Meddetereanan."
italy.120.d:0 "The nation of Italy has offered to sell us the territory of Panfilia. For centuries this land has been the home of millions of Turks who were as a result of the Great War stolen from us. While our two nations have much animosity between each other we must respect Italy's choice to reconcile with us."
italy.1212.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our proposal to purchase Panfilia. Hopefully this will not only help ease relations with Turkey but also ease the economic burden off our taxpayers."
italy.121.d:0 "The nation of Italy has offered to sell us the territory of Panfilia. Until very recently this land was the home of thousands of Greeks who were brutally forced out or assimilated by the Turks. We must undo this wrong and bring Greek influence back to Panfilia."
italy.1202.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our proposal to purchase Panfilia. Hopefully this will not only help ease relations with Turkey but also ease the economic burden off our taxpayers."
italy.123.d:0 "Italian divisions stationed in Panfilia close to the Turkish border have reported fire from Turkish positions. The bombardment is reported to be extremely heavy and reinforcements may need to be called in to stabilize the situation."
italy.124.d:0 "After hours of shelling from Turkish forces, Italian defenders in Panfilia were forced back from the border and closer to the Meddetereanan coast. A final advance by Turkish troops however forced the Italians to abandon Anatolia entirely. Turkey now stands the victor in this short undeclared conflict."
italy.126.d:0 "A short skirmish between Turkish and Italian troops in Panfilia ends indecisively as both side declare victory over the other."
italy.125.d:0 "In a daring raid Turkish troops attempted to overrun the Italian garrison in Panfilia but thanks to better training and equipment the Italin forces were able to hold there ground."
italy.130.d:0 "The Panfilia issue has soured relations with Turkey ever since the end of the Great War. Now though a large build up of Turkish troops have gathered on the Panfilia border seemingly prepared to strike at any moment. We must keep our eyes open for any further developments."
italy.131.d:0 "The socialist government of Italy believes that scientific cooperation between the socialist nations of the world is the key to spreading and developing socialism. It's hard to disagree with there points but some officials worry that spreading research into the increasingly volatile Western Europe may pose a security threat towards our nation."
italy.132.d:0 "The Soviets agree to share scientific developments with us. Together we will bring progress to the workers of the world"
italy.133.d:0 "The Soviet Union has refused to share it;s scientific developments with us. Now it seems were must bring the light of scientific progress to the workers of the world on our own."
italy.134.d:0 "As the dominant power in the Mediterranean, Italy wishes to spread peace and security through the region. To accomplish this goal they have offered to send volunteers to help fight for our cause. While more men are always helpful some officials fear that Italy may be planning to gain too much influence over our nation."
italy.140.d:0 "The Croatian revolt has been raging for months now, and the Croatian population in Dalmatia has finally decided to join their traitorous brothers in arms against both Hungary and Serbia. We must now join the war against the Croatian State, and restore peace to the region once and for all."
italy.140.a:0 "The powderkeg never disappoints..."

italy.141.t:0 "Croatia wins their independence."
italy.141.d:0 "The fighting has dragged on for many long months now, and we are unable to make a significant dent in our enemies defenses. A delegation has been sent by both of our allies, asking for peace, and we must now follow suit. We cannot defeat the Croatians together, let alone by ourselves. Croatia will have their state, until the next major war allows us to reclaim our rightful territories."
italy.141.a:0 "This is a day which will live in infamy..."

italy.142.t:0 "Hungary demands Ljubljana!"
italy.142.d:0 "The Hungarian nation has taken a path of extreme expansionism, and they have decided to send us a list of demands, notably including the transfer of Ljubljana over to them. While we could almost certainly defeat the Hungarians in a war, it would cause many deaths and may harm our reputation within the European community. How shall we respond?"
italy.142.a:0 "It is a small concession for lasting peace."
italy.142.b:0 "We will not give an inch of ground!"
italy.200.t:0 "A Nation under siege"
italy.200.d:0 "A Terrorist attack by the Formazioni di difesa proletaria (Formations for Proletariat Defense), a newly constituted Communist Group, shocked the entire nation this Morning. A previously planted bomb, was detonated at hours 10.46, on the Headquarter of the Liberal Party killing three and injuring several members of the party. According to witnesses, the bomb, was planted yesterday night by a group of 4 young men. The Revendication of the attack by the Group happened in the early afternoon. 1\nThe Police and the Carabinieri have already started the investigation and in the parliament talks have already begun about whatever or not increase security in public places...

italy.203.d:0 "After the discovering of the Terrorists' shelter, a convoy of policemen, reached the zone but the Terrorists were waiting there. The Men prepared an ambush to the police squad, when they arrived bullets were fired and after losing one man the Governmnet Forces had to retire with shame. Even after this humiliating lost we need to stand up and keep fighting those barbarians wherever there's need"
italy.203.a:0 "What a humiliating action"
italy.205.t:0 "An Armed Resistance forms"
italy.205.d:0 "The Terrorists have refused to accept talks with the Government and started a resistance on the mountains. A communicate saying that the Formazioni di Difesa Proletaria will never collaborate with the current govenment, reached the Parliament this morning. Statemen were rather sad but not surprised, but the most worrying thing is that civils are reporting groups of people carrying Red Flags and Rifles moving to the Mountains. If the situation escalates we may find ourselves in a situation worse than the one that occurred ten nearly twenty years ago, we need to take actions before they organise."

The so-called Squadre d'Azione (Action's Squads) begun to organize in all the major cities and to raid Leftists Journals. If we play our cards with wisdom we can manage to use those extremists against the insurgents, but the more moderate exponents of our government might not be in favour of this."

A Dozen of people, wearing the characteristic Blackshirt, broke into the manifestant and started to disperse the crowd. The workers have managed to stay calm and not attack back, but the longer it lasts the worst it will become.

ITA_Rodolfo_Graziani_desc:0 "§GMilitary Dossier\n§GBorn:§W11 August 1882 Filettino, Italy\n§GMilitary Career:§WGraziani joined the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in 1903 and was soon stationed in Italian Eritrea. His first taste of success came during the Italo-Turkish war where he was promoted to Captain. He would continue to command forces during the Great War where his efforts would lead him to become the youngest Colonel in the Italian Army. Following Italy's victory against the Central Powers in 1919 Graziani became very influential on the affairs of Italy's newly gained possessions. He became infamous for his willingness to use any means necessary to assert Italian dominance over the local populations. With help from the local Greeks and in Panfilia, Graziani lead a brutal suppression of Turks in the region accused of supporting the Turkish National Movement. In Italian Cameroon he defeated a short lived guerrilla movement, forcing much of the civilian population into concentration camps and burning down thousands of square miles of jungle in the process. In Italy he is seen by many as a great Pacifier but those who have been the target of his wrath call him a butcher. Graziani is deeply conservative and believes that strong and iron fisted authority is needed to solve Italy's internal problems.\n§GNotes:§W\n-Tyrannical Authoritarian\n-Unprepared for another 'Great War'\n-Politically ambitious"
