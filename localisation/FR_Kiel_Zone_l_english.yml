#### IDEAS ####

SHO_hamburg_legacy:0 "Spectre of the Hamburg Commune"
SHO_hamburg_legacy_desc:0 "The short-lived Collectivist revolt in Hamburg during 1927 was barely put down by the occupying Danish forces. The legacy of the Hamburg Commune lives on, 9 years later.

SHO_nazbol_gang:0 "National Collectivism"

SHO_political_repression:0 "Political Repression"
SHO_political_repression_desc:0 "Despite that Democratic movements have achieved Democracy in Denmark itself, the Kiel Zone has remained under a Transitional Government for aproxmiately 6 years now. Many rights still have not been restored, and the Danish Transitional Government actively attempts to dismantle all Collectivist organziations before further reform."
