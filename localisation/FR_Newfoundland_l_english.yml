#### Events ####
nfl.1.d:0 "Newfoundland is an old nation during changing times. Newfoundland was first granted responsible government in the 1850’s, and subsequently rejected becoming a participant in the Canadian Confederation in contrast to their maritime neighbors; Nova Scotia & New Brunswick, whom had opted for Confederation. In the upcoming years, Newfoundland would remain isolated and contentedly focusing on herself, undertaking impressive National Projects such as the construction of the Newfoundland Railway, which pushed the country into debt. The Great War came and went, and when the War came to an end, nobody in Newfoundland heaved a sigh of relief. The issue of military pensions became an immediate concern for the Government, as they found themselves not only indebted to Canada and Britain, but also to their own populace. In order to slow their spiral into unsustainable debt, Newfoundland had immediately demobilized and massively cut down on military spending and maintenance. As the 1920’s rolled around and the Imperial Economic Boom began, their economic decline was slowly halted. Admittedly, their economy was far from in a preferable position, and the same could be said for their debt; nevertheless the situation was finally stabilized. A rise in consumption of minerals and food within the Empire had provided Newfoundland’s Government with the opportunity to slowly pay off their debts to Canada and Britain. However, Austerity measures were taken in order to procure these funds, much to the dismay of the populace. Payments of military pensions were cut, which infuriated and alienated many of Newfoundland’s Great-War Veterans. Furthermore, the wages of Miners within Newfoundland were cut at regular intervals by business owners in an attempt to maximize profits. Whilst this was not a move by the Government, it nonetheless spurred the growth of Trade Unions in Newfoundland’s mining industry, which was previously limited to the fishing industry. Coupled with this, it pushed a large portion of the working class to the left and radicalized existing trade unions. In 1929, the Miner’s Central Union was created with the mission of organizing the various mining unions of Newfoundland. The 1932 General Election saw yet another victory of the Conservatives; the United Newfoundland Party. Whilst sympathies to the Conservatives wasn’t exactly high, they managed to pull off a victory due to lacking any real opposition and promises to repeal Austerity measures. Frederick Alderdice formed a cabinet and decided to stay true to his platform by halting Austerity measures, firmly under the belief that with the economy of the British Empire ever-improving there would be little need for such measures, as it’d be possible to pay off the debts at a slow rate. Unfortunately for the UNP, one year later, prices for fish took an unexpected fall. With a majority of Newfoundland’s population being reliant on fishing; this was incredibly dangerous. Newfoundland was pushed into economic instability yet once again. The Fishermen's Protective Union had been instrumental in protecting Newfoundland’s fisherman from having their wages slashed, however some businesses were drove out of Newfoundland and into Canada instead, much to the dismay of Newfoundland’s Government. Despite the unfortunate situation, with ongoing colonial unrest in Africa and India, Newfoundland became a more appealing trade partner for Mineral exports. In spite of this, the Indian Rebellion of 1935 would cause consumption of Minerals to rapidly fall, and thus the good they were economically reliant on had shifted back to fish. As investor confidence in colonial holdings has steadily begun to decline, Newfoundland was no exception to this forlorn circumstance. As their economic struggle begins to become more perceptible,very  few can anticipate what type of future awaits Newfoundland in the upcoming years of instability; but all observers can agree that Newfoundland, as we know it, is running on borrowed time."
nfl.2.d:0 "Following a catastrophic fall in the value of stocks in the London Stock Market, economic depression ensued for all nations within the empire, and even extended across the globe. Unfortunately, this extends to us. Our already fragile economy has had its only pillars of support kicked out from under it, and we've begun to find ourselfs rapidly falling into Economic crisis. "
