pru.1.t:0 "Perú in 1936"
pru.1.d:0 "Many years have passed since the Great War shocked the world, many empires and nations have risen and crumbled after this world event. Peru, however, has been doing pretty well by itself. \n Externally, our nations has proven its worth in South America after our glorious victory against Colombia just two years ago, where brave general Sánchez lead us. Now our territory and the people in it have expanded, and everyone can see we are on the rise. \n Internally, our nation is steadily developing, our many resources and diverse people bolstering us. However, for far too many years our people have lost the taste of democracy as president Leguía made the state his toy and unraveled our constitution. Now that he left, weak in health, General Sánchez has rightfully been elected our new leader, and while many rather radical left-wing extremists oppose his rule, the same way he opposes them, many of us are hopeful he will repair our republic and guide our nation in its peak."
pru.1.a:0 "We stand firm and happy for the Union."

pru.2.t:0 "The Constitutional Matter"
pru.2.d:0 "While the dictatorship has ended and the future is hopeful, the faults in our government system are still felt and seen. Leguía's changes made the constitution very liberal and eliminated many of the checks for a functioning democracy, nonetheless even with this changes he had no fear of ignoring it as he pleased. \n Now, our presindent Sánchez Cerro has a choice to make in his hands, will he build a new constitution based on a strong democracy and a republic that truly represents the peruvian people, or will he build a constitution with an strong, centralized power that won't ever be ignored, and will provide us with so desired stability, even if losing the meaning of our republic?"
pru.2.a:0 "The Republic's democracy will be reforged."
pru.2.b:0 "What Perú truly needs is a strong, lawful government for once."

pru.3.t:0 "Parlamentary Elections"
pru.3.d:0 "As part of the constitutional reforms to our democracy, new parlamentary elections have been called, with the new, more representative electoral system. Many are the parties that will use this opportunity to try and get a majority and become part of the government. \n Now that Perú is finally getting what it wants, what will it choose?"
pru.3.a:0 "The conservative Movimiento Democrático Peruano, promising wide social reforms with conservative values."
pru.3.b:0 "The center-left Frente Democrático Nacional, promising new civil freedoms and a conciliatory effort."
pru.3.c:0 "The ruling party, Unión Revolucionaria, popular from Sanchéz recent reforms and Peru's success."
pru.4.t:0 "Worker discontent on the Regime"
pru.4.d:0 "Many are the loyal peruvians that happily support our president's rule over them. However, some extremists denouncing our "lack of democracy" have been causing trouble. While these aren't news to us, a lot of workers on different areas of our country have risen in their support. Our society is resisting our rule."
pru.4.a:0 "Those damned collies..."
pru.5.t:0 "Suspension of Democracy"
pru.5.d:0 "The ultimate conclusion has been reached by our president. Democracy was what set the republic back for so long. And the desire for it only has disunited our people. The solution is clear, the permanent suspension of democracy has began. Now our leader Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro will lead our country with a strong lawful government, without the meddling of democracy into our firm state institutions, finally will the country be ruled only by the best, personally selected by our president to aid him in his rule, to aid the whole nation. Still, while many cheer, many seem to be doubtful of this brilliant decision."
pru.5.a:0 "Under Permanent Rule by president Sánchez Cerro Perú will always be great."
pru.6.t:0 "Democratic Opposition opposes Government"
pru.6.d:0 "Our move hasn't only bothered socialist circles, as the leaders of different democratic parties have united in denouncing the government's decision as unconstitutional. It's very odd, this is almost as if they didn't understand the constitution hasn't meant anything for a while now."
pru.6.a:0 "Nor they understand we don't need them anymore."
pru.7.t:0 "Democratic Opposition mobilizes"
pru.7.d:0 "It seems that the "democratic opposition" still holds to the hope they can take the reins in our nation. While this is more than unlikely, that hasn't stopped them from trying, and tensions have spread as it seems many of them have been in recent contact with rival powers, likely trying to fund some kind of upstart movement."
pru.7.a:0 "Maybe we should teach them a lesson."
pru.7.b:0 "I'm sure it's nothing."
pru.8.t:0 "The Threat of the Left"
pru.8.d:0 "The years under Leguía didn't do good to our nation, as the former president's will was made reality in every way, and he shaped Perú into his personal domain. Someone that was benefitted from it, however, was the left, that in opposition to the so called president-dictator, proclaimed its wishes to liberate Peru from his tyranny. Now that he is gone, however, the threat still remains, and while many distrust of our president, maybe only he can save us from falling into disarray."
pru.8.a:0 "We need to stand together in the upcoming chaos."
pru.19.t:0 "Peru-Colombian Tensions"
pru.19.d:0 "It's been some years since our conflict with Colombia ended, while our victory brought glory and stability to our nation, Colombia wasn't as lucky.\n\nThe military failure coupled with government ineptitude lead to extreme nationalist rising in power, and now Colombia is governed by these extremist groups. As they have announce their ambitions to reclaim what was lost in the war, we must be careful at handling this situation."
pru.19.a:0 "We won't surrender to extremists."
pru.20.d:0 "The dissident to our nationalist regime have recently begin increasing their unlawful activities. Our men have quickly found out that the peruvians have been backing them. First they take our land, now this? They must pay for this transgression into our nation."
pru.20.t:0 "Dissident activity increases"
pru.20.a:0 "Perú will pay."
pru.21.t:0 "Disputes over Pastaza"
pru.21.d:0 "For decades already our claims over Pastaza and Ecuador's have conflicted. Now, once again, the tensions have increased, as aggressive settlements in the zone have sparked dialogue between our diplomats.\n\nStriving to avoid conflict and solve the matter diplomatically, two options have come around. The first one, to offer to buy the territory from Ecuador, recognizing their legal control over the zone but seeking to switch this around. Alternatively, some diplomats believe aggresively stating our position and demanding they cede control over the area peacefully may be a situable alternative."
pru.21.a:0 "Let's make them an offer they can't refuse and try to buy."
pru.21.b:0 "Let's ask them nicely to give back our rightful land."
pru.22.t:0 "Offer from Peru for Pastaza"
pru.22.d:0 "As part of its perpertually expansionist policy, Perú has began showing ambitions upon our integral region of Pastaza once again. This time, they are trying to expand diplomatically, and have submitted a rather cheap offer to buy the territory from us."
pru.22.a:0 "It seems like a wise deal."
pru.22.b:0 "This is frankly, insulting."
pru.23.t:0 "Peru demands we hand Pastaza"
pru.23.d:0 "As part of its perpertually expansionist policy, Perú has began showing ambitions upon our integral region of Pastaza once again. This time, they are demanding we abandon our settlements and hand over our rightful territory."
pru.23.a:0 "I guess we have no choice."
pru.23.b:0 "Poor attempt at "diplomacy"."
pru.24.t:0 "Ecuador fulfills our ambitions"
pru.24.d:0 "The Ecuadorian government issued a reply, they have agreed to our terms! The province of Pastaza, our rightful territory, now belongs to us completely."
pru.24.a:0 "I love diplomacy."
pru.25.t:0 "Ecuador rejects our terms"
pru.25.d:0 "As the official reply was received, we are surprised to find that Ecuador rejected our terms. Now that diplomacy has failed, it seems only the battlefields could solve this issue."
pru.25.a:0 "As they want."
pru.26.d:0 "Since the War of the Pacific decades ago, our country was shamed by Chile as they took away our southern provinces. While we were able to regain Tacna diplomatically, our territory is yet complete.\n\nChile hasn't been doing so well, maybe an offer to buy the land would be a good idea, or maybe we could exploit its weakness and demand they cede it back."
pru.26.t:0 "Ambitions over Arica"
pru.26.a:0 "Offer to buy it"
pru.26.b:0 "Take a chance and try to exploit their weakness, demand it!"
pru.27.t:0 "Perú offers to buy Arica"
pru.27.d:0 "Not forgetting the conflicts of old, even after regaining Tacna, the peruvians now show ambitions over Arica, too! For now, they try to solve the "conflict" diplomatically, and knowing the economic difficulties we have been going through, have offered to buy Arica from us."
pru.27.a:0 "It may be for the best."
pru.27.b:0 "This is, frankly, insulting."
pru.28.t:0 "Perú demans we hand Arica"
pru.28.d:0 "Not forgetting the conflicts of old, even after regaining Tacna, the peruvians now show ambitions over Arica, too! For now, they try to solve the "conflict" diplomatically, and confusing our chaos for weakness, have demanded we hand over Arica peacefully."
pru.28.a:0 "We may have no choice."
pru.28.b:0 "We won't fall for these insults."
pru.29.t:0 "Chile fulfills our ambitions"
pru.29.d:0 "The Chilean government issued a reply, they have agreed to our terms! The province of Arica, our rightful territory, now belongs to us completely."
pru.29.a:0 "I love diplomacy."
pru.30.t:0 "Chile rejects our terms"
pru.30.d:0 "As the official reply was received, we are surprised to find that Chile rejected our terms. Now that diplomacy has failed, it seems only the battlefields could solve this issue."
pru.30.a:0 "As they want."
pru.40.t:0 "The Fate of Bolivia"
pru.40.d:0 "As the Bolivian government fell, our forces have come to occupy their territory, as we spread our control after the war. Now, however, has come the time to decide what will the Fate of Bolivia will be.\n\nWith increasingly worrying amounts of discontent in the occupied land, it may be a smart move to establish a friendly regime, safely placed under our protection and control, to govern the Bolivians. Some believe that direct rule from Lima might be a better idea, however."
pru.40.a:0 "Liberate Bolivia as a friendly regime."
pru.40.b:0 "Let us rule them directly."
pru.50.t:0 "The Market Crash arrives to Perú"
pru.50.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has shocked the world, and with it, our economy. Everything seems to be upside down as we need to come up with a solution for this quick. We can't risk losing internal stability."
pru.50.a:0 "Dang."
pru.60.t:0 "Protests as government begins centralization"
pru.60.d:0 "Perú has always sought a stable, powerful rule. That's why it has come as a surprise to us when protesters began mobilizing in our principal cities.\n\nRegarding our reforms as "tyrannic" and "stratocratic", these groups seem to be mainly unionist and syndicalist dissidents."
pru.60.a:0 "Get rid of them."
pru.60.b:0 "Let them calm down."
pru.61.t:0 "Unionists reach agreement"
pru.61.d:0 "An agreement has been reached on a long term plan of action with several active unionist leaders.\n\nThis accord seems to be promising, and the tensions in our society seem to be reducing themselves."
pru.61.a:0 "Yay!"
pru.62.t:0 "APRA mobilization prevented"
pru.62.d:0 "As the extreme forces driving towards the radicalization of the lower classes known as the APRA continues expanding their agenda, we have succesfully found out about the organization of planning stages for upcoming workers' strikes that would very much affect our economy.\n\nOur forces took this information to their advantage and were able to raid and detain several of the organizers, although the confrontation seems to have rather radicalized the movement even more."
pru.62.a:0 "Deal with them using force."
pru.62.b:0 "Don't proceed on the matter."

pru.100.d:0 "As our troops occupy their country, it seems our objectives have been finally attained. While we can just take what we came for, some suggest alternatively continuing and going for everything.\n\nWhat should we do?"
pru.100.t:0 "Military Goal Success"
pru.100.a:0 "Let's take what we came here for."
pru.100.b:0 "Go for everything."
pru.101.d:0 "As our troops occupy their country, it seems our objectives have been finally attained. While we can just take what we came for, some suggest alternatively continuing and going for everything.\n\nWhat should we do?"

pru.101.a:0 "Let's take what we came here for."
pru.101.b:0 "Go for everything."
pru.102.d:0 "As our troops occupy their country, it seems our objectives have been finally attained. While we can just take what we came for, some suggest alternatively continuing and going for everything.\n\nWhat should we do?"
pru.102.t:0 "Military Goal Success"
pru.102.a:0 "Let's take what we came here for."
pru.102.b:0 "Go for everything."
pru.103.d:0 "As our troops occupy their country, it seems our objectives have been finally attained. While we can just take what we came for, some suggest alternatively continuing and going for everything.\n\nWhat should we do?"
pru.103.t:0 "Military Goal Success"
pru.103.a:0 "Let's take what we came here for."
pru.103.b:0 "Go for everything."
pru.1337.t:0 "Socialist Uprising"
pru.1337.d:0 "As expected, the reaction to the suspension of democracy in Perú was rather divisive, and the APRA has used it to their advantage, declaring an open insurrection against our president. Several traditional parties, feeling threatened by the regime's decision have joined in to their cause.\n\nLooks like arms will be the only way to deal with traitors now."
pru.1337.a:0 "Muerte a los traidores!"
pru.1337.b:0 "The Revolutionaries seize Lima."
pru.1338.t:0 "Wut"
pru.1338.d:0 "No one will read this."
pru.1338.a:0 "Don't you dare post this on reddit."
pru.1339.t:0 "Reactionary forces rise up"
pru.1339.d:0 "As the revolutionaries take Lima, and the Chairman Haya de la Torre leads the birth of the socialist republic, the reactionaries are still looking to get rid of us. Lead by the deposed president Sánchez, they have reunited with the military's support and taken arms to stop our glorious revolution.\nWe can't let them win."
pru.1339.a:0 "Arriba la Revolución!"
