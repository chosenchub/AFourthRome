###Pre Crisis Stuff###
rhi.0.d:0 "|NOTE| The Rhine is heavily WIP and is missing content early on, along with content past late 1938, so play at your own risk!\n\nThe History of the Rhenish state begins not with its formation, but with the Great War. The Rhine was a stronghold of the German economy, lush with people, coal, iron, and come 1919, blood. The Entente pushed the German army to the east bank of the Rhine in the 1919 offensive, and the industrial base of Germany was put under allied occupation. When the Germans surrendered soon after, the allies remained in the Rhine, ensuring that German reparations would be paid through the direct control of Germany’s coal and iron. The United States, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom formed the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission to “Ensure, by any means, the security and satisfaction of all the needs of the Armies of Occupation”. The Rhenish occupation was in truth anything but an Inter-Allied operation, with the United States post war isolation and the withdrawal of all allied forces but those of France. \n\nThe occupation force found that it would be no easy task to control the wealth of the Rhine as the Spartacist Revolution of 1919 led to thousands of Rhenish insurgents attempting to take control of the region. The French army, with support of the Freikorps, managed to put down the revolt and crush the communist presence in the region. The following decade found the Rhine in a state of uneasy peace, with French police cracking down on revolutionaries and rebels and sporadic strikes. \n\nThis all changed suddenly with Dresslers coup. The Rhenish powder keg was lit aflame once more. Hans Adam Dorten, a Freikorps and WW1 veteran, reformed a Freikorps militia with the aid of the popular Rhenish nationalist Josef Friedreich Matthes, declared in the Wiesbaden Proclamation the formation of “The Independent Rhenish Republic” and began Mainz Putsche. The Rhenish militia soon found their numbers to be in the hundreds instead of thousands, having vastly overestimated their own popularity. The French occupant General Charles Mangin refused to wipe out the insurgents with his force, instead proposing to High Commissioner Paul Tirard that they may use the insurgents against the rebelling Valkist and resurgent communist forces. The following Leipzig Declaration was issued, stating that “The formation of a Rhenish state shall occur upon the stabilization of the Rhine”, while Dorten and Matthes were often amnesty in exchange for using the Freikorps to crush the rebellions throughout the Rhine. Dorten and Matthes agreed, and soon a revitalized Freikorps with Rhenish aid defeated the Ruhr Rebellion. It is also notable that during the chaos of 1932, the Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, made a name for himself for his support of the French occupation, famously saying that it was “the rare case in which the conquered is satisfied with the conquerer”, speaking of how the French occupation has protected them from the Valkists.\n\nThe fires of 1932 were stomped out, but the embers of the Rhine may yet again set the powderkeg aflame."
rhi.1.d:0 "The Rhine is full of a diverse array of political parties and figures, six of which have sway over the population.\n\nFree Arbeiter Union Rheinlands (FAUR)\nLed by the socialist Rudolf Rocker, the Free Worker’s Union of the Rhineland is the only remaining radical socialist organization in the Rhine. Composed of trade unionists and the few remnants of the Spartacists, the FAUR has lost any real power in the Rhine under the weight of the Freikorps watchful eye. \n\nSozialdemokratische Partei Rheinlands (SDPR)\nLed by Josef Friedreich Matthes, the SPR forms one of the largest parties seeking independence. Promised a sovereign state by the French in 1933, the party has been tolerated as Matthes is willing to cooperate with local authorities, at least for now.\n\nReinische Zentrumspartei\nLed by Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Cologne, the Zentrum are the most willing to cooperate with French authorities, and actively seek autonomy instead of independence.\n\nRheinische Volkspartei (RVP)\nLed by Hans Adam Dorten, the Volkspartei seeks the complete independence of the Rhine from foreign control. The most uncontrollable of the tolerated political parties, the Volkspartei is allowed due to the use of its military wing, the Rhenische Freikorps, in suppressing left wing dissent. The size and power of the Freikorps is worrying to many, but for now they are loyal.\n\nDeutsche Vaterlandspartei (DVP)\nLed by Heinrich Himmler, a TST member, the DVP is officially banned but has yet to be squashed. Himmler was a low level TST member until a string of bloodshed led to the deaths of his superior, vaulting him to the top. He is a methodical man, fanatically devoted to the German Fatherland, and is viewed as extremely dangerous due to his pro-German unification stance and party.\n\nFinally, the Rhine itself is ruled by the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission. Originally a venture between the United States, France, Britain, and Italy, the Commision has turned into for all intents and purposes a French substate with some marginal British influence and is controlled through local collaborationists and the aid of the French military. Paul Tirard, the High Commissioner, is a mild mannered man who relies heavily upon the local cooperation of the SDPR and Freikorps to maintain control. Behind him is the aging Charles Mangin, nicknamed the Butcher, who may provide a more firm hand if the situation escalates."
rhi.2.d:0 "The beginning of the new year comes with the drafting of a new budget. The Inter-Allied High Commission receives the majority of its funds directly from the French government, with the rest coming from inefficient taxation within the Rhine itself. E.F. Schumacher, the economic adviser to Paul Tirard, has pushed quite heavily for an infrastructure spending packet. While this will certainly enable the Rhenish economy by strengthening the rail lines and road networks, our budget is already quite tight, so others in the government, including the popular German advisor Karl von Starck, have suggested that funding be saved for unexpected costs that may arise throughout the year. "
rhi.3.d:0 "May Day, as expected, has resulted in protests throughout the Rhine from the leftists and unionists. Organized by the FAUR and tacitly supported by the Sozialdemokratische partei, this years protests have led to widespread rioting. The freikorps remains at our disposal, and would certainly be the easiest way to control the leftist rabble. Many within the government have begun to worry that the freikorps are growing far too powerful, however, and we could simply allow the police to deal with the riots, even if they are undermanned. Finally, we could recognize the protests as legitimate as a show of goodwill, only arresting violent protesters, but, doing so may further embolden the leftist radicals. "
#rhi.3.d:0 "As the Valkists took power in Germany theoretical physicist Albert Eistein was forced to flee Germany do to his advocacy of Socialism. For the last few years he has made the Rhineland his home and has helped to establish his scientific theories into Rhenish intelectual circles. In the face of another Valkist takeover however the scientist has decided to flee once again to Paris. While his work in science can not be forgotten we must not tolerate his views on Socialism."
###Rhine Crisis###
rhi.10.d:0 "The market clash has set the political powderkeg of the Rhine aflame! Once more, strikes are being organized by the FAUD, and the economy of the Rhine has come to a halt. The fate of the Rhine lies in the balance."
rhi.11.d:0 "The French have shown their true colors and abandoned the Rhine to its fate. Without economic aid, the situation has continued to worsen, and calls for independence ring out. The Vaterlandspartei of Heinrich Himmler has grown tremendously larger as calls for unification grow, while Hans Adam Dorten has reformed the Freikorps and begun organizing for revolution. Even among these, however, there are more moderate voices, with Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Koln, calling for peace and autonomy from France, rather than all out war. Josef Friedrich Matthes, the leader of the Sozialdemokratische Partei, has called for a peaceful solution to this violence. The Rhine is aflame."
rhi.12.d:0 "While sporadic clashes have occured between Freikorps, socialist strikes, and French police, the violence in the Rhine has not yet overflown. Today, Josef Matthes has called for a conferance to decide the fate of the Rhine. Both Dorten and Adenauer have agreed to these terms, and it seems, perhaps peace may be restored. This conference, however, may very well result in the independence of the Rhine, so many within the Inter-Allied Commision have called for the arrest of Dorten, Adenauer, and Matthes to end this rebellion before it can begin."
rhi.13.d:0 "Like Rome before us future historians will debate what brought on the collapse of the Rhineland. Whether it was the central governments unwillingness to compromise with opposing factions or there failiure to eliminate political dissidents, the Rhine now stands on the edge of being a failed state. Many of our citisens who onced called themsleves moderates now flock to the Vaterlandspartei who promise them stability under Germany's guidance."
rhi.14.d:0 "The French have allowed the conference to go forth, stating they will respect the results of the conference. Political leaders, mayors, and delegates from across the Rhine have met in Essen to debate and decide upon the fate of the Rhine. Three key camps have made themselves evident in the early days- the Volkspartei of Hans Adam Dorten is small but has garnered support amongst both the common man and military generals, while the Zentrumspartei of Konrad Adenauer appeals to many who seek peace in the Rhine. Dorten demands non-negotiable independence, while Adenauer seeks autonomy. The third party, the Sozialdemokratisches of Josef Friedrich Matthes, remain undecided as of now, making them perhaps the turning point of the debate."
rhi.15.d:0 "The first week of the conference has been full of heated discussion and forming factions. Matthes may ally himself with either Dorten or Adenauer to seek Rhenish independence, or, he may choose to stand alone. His decision will be critical to the future of the Rhine."
rhi.16.d:0 "The second week of debate continued with deadlock, but amongst it Konrad Adenauer rose to the podium to give the most powerful speech of the night, saying, "We are the rare case where the conquered is very satisfied with the conqueror." Already famous throughout the Rhine, his defence of the French occupation has made him known. He continued to speak of how the French, with all their flaws, are the only force which has allowed the Rhine to remain free of Valkist tyranny, and are the best protection an autonomous Rhine may find. The reception of this great speech however, is yet to be decided."
rhi.17.d:0 "The third week of the Rhenish conference has found itself locked on the issue of French economic control. Two camps have again materialized, centering on the conflict between Dorten and Korad. Dorten has proposed uncompromising nationalization of the Rhenish economy, demanding that the French cede all influence within it. Konrad, instead, wishes to gradually gain economic autonomy and invite French investors."
rhi.18.d:0 "The Rhine conference has ended at last! Hans Adam Dorten managed to rally the delegation to supporting his proposal. Matthes however, has been designated as the leader of the Rhine, in order to appease all camps. Dorten has still maintained a position center stage, giving a speech before the people,"It is the lost treasure of the Rhine, who commits the god of the Occident, the Latin god, to a murderous fight against the destructive forces of Asgard threatening from the darkness of the East ... The Rhenish people, the people of Siegfried, borne by Latin tradition and Christian mission, seeks to save the peace of God threatened by the East." The speech, a reference to the old norse saga of Siegfried the Burgundian slayer of dragons, states in no uncertain terms Dorten's disdain for Valkism."
rhi.19.d:0 "The Rhenish conference has decided to back Konrad Adenauer's plan for cooperation and autonomy under French protection. Dorten, clearly angered by this, said in a simple statement, “I do not damn the man, but to hell with his ideas!” before heading off. Dorten has decided to respect the conference and support the decision with his Freikorps, resulting in a sigh of relief from those worried of civil war. Talks with France about the details of the autonomy have begun, and it seems that a great friendship may be forged this day!"
rhi.20.d:0 "As the situation continues to fall apart in the Rhineland the Vaterlandspartei has decided to march on Coblence in an attempt to secure power for there movement. We must fight off any faction which seeks to undermine our government."
rhi.21.d:0 "To help aleviate the crisis currently efflicting the Rhine, France has sent monetary aid to our government to help our nation to get back on it's feet once again."
rhi.22.d:0 "Konrad Adenauer has proposed a Rhenish autonomy to help secure the Rhine in this crisis. This idea, popular with Paul Tirard and the government as the situation in the Rhine becomes increasily desperate, would still need to be allowed by the French Government who rule over us.."
rhi.23.d:0 "The French agree with Adenauer's plan and support granting our state more autonomy over our internal affairs."
rhi.24.d:0 "Failiure to find a solution to the Rhenish political crisis has emboldened the Valkists to take up arms and resist against our weak state. Adenauer has bypassed us and appealed to the French directly with his proposal! The fate of the Rhine has fallen entirely from our hands."
rhi.31.d:0 "The Rhinish government's failiure to maintain peace within it's borders has forced France to establish a mandate over our nation. For the foreseable future France will have direct control over the politics and administration of the Rhine."
rhi.32.d:0 "To many a French Rhine was always doomed to fail. The Rhine is German and has always been German. No more will we be the lesser partner to a foreign power. Germany is our future."
rhi.33.d:0 "Talks with France have resulted in an agreement- An autonomous Rhenish Republic shall be formed underneath the leadership of Konrad Adenauer. Tirard and Adenauer signed the documents symbolically, and, upon the creation of the Rhenish Republic, President Adenauer's first order of business was the appointment of Josef Friedrich Matthes as his chancellor. While they have their differences, the coalition government has enabled the Rhine to have broad popular support. The Rhenish National Assembly’s first order of business was to sign an agreement of perpetual alliance to France. While this was met with general positivity, many in the newly formed assembly were quick to point out that France required the continuation of coal shipments and an unequal trade agreement. Nevertheless, the Rhine has come far from what it once was."
rhi.34.d:0 "After deliberation, the Rhenish Conference has decided upon the framework of the Rhenish Confederation (Rheinisch Bund). Based heavily upon the Weimar Republic, the government largely mirrors it. As a federal republic, the government shall be lead by a strong President (Bundespräsident) and a limited Chancellor (Bundeskanzler). Finally, the Rhenish National Assembly (Rheinisch Nationalversammlung) will form the legislative body of government. The largest differences between the Rhenish government and the Weimar is the establishment of a strong independent judiciary; the Rhenish National Court (Rheinisches Landesgericht). \n\nThe National Convention has decided that the first elections shall occur in January of 1938 and repeat every four years after that to help ensure presidential accountability. Until then, the provisional government has been formed with Josef Friedrich Matthes as the acting President, and the outspoken nationalist Hans Adam Dorten as the chancellor, with members of the constitutional delegation forming the National Assembly."
rhi.35.d:0 "While the coalition government of Matthes of Dorten was originally created to have a stable Rhine, the ideological differences between Dorten and Matthes have grown too large to ignore. Matthes promotes a pacifistic social democratic state in cooperation with France, while Dorten has pushed heavily for nationalization of resources and the expansion of the Rhine."
rhi.50.d:0 "The Rhineland has brought France and Germany into conflict countless times over the centuries. The industrial revolution has made the Rhine one of the most productive abd valuable regions in the world. Those who control the Rhine control Europe so when the French occupied the valley following the Great War it was of no surprise that this would spark revanchism in the German people. German Fuhrer Adam Dressler now demands that a referendum takes place within our nation to determine the status of the Rhineland. Though our nation has generally been divided down the middle between pro-French and pro-German positions, economic and political instability has pushed more and more of our citisens to support German rule. We must be cautious with how we proceed."
rhi.51.d:0 "The Rhineland has brought France and Germany into conflict countless times over the centuries.

Though our nation has generally been divided down the middle between pro-French and pro-German positions, economic and political instability has pushed more and more of our citisens to support German rule. We must be cautious with how we proceed."
rhi.53.d:0 "To appease Germany we have decided to go through with a Referendum. The vote will be a simple choice between two options. Either to maintain the status quo or unify with Germany. Despite some worries of the unification vote winning most experts agree such a scenario is unlikly."
rhi.101.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has sent a shockwave across the globe. In Rhineland, our buffer between us and Germany, the economic disaster has crippled the nation's ability to effectively manage it's internal affairs. We may have to intervene and help the Rhine restablish itself but many ministers are argue that France is in no position to economically support itself, let alone another nation."
rhi.102.d:0 "The political situation in the Rhinland has completly broken down. A thorough solution will need to to be found to help alleviate this situation. Though some ministers wish to compromise with the Rhine and find a diplomatic solution it may be time to send in French troops to restore order."
rhi.103.d:0 "Any semblance of control in the Rhineland has collapsed. The nation is on verge of a full blown civil war and without immediate support the national government in Coblence is doomed to collapse. While our army is ready to intervene if we give the word many ministers in Paris debate the value of contined support of such and innefective government."
rhi.104.d:0 "Konrad Adenauer has approached our government with a plan to help alleviate the crisis in the Rhineland. In his plan the Rhenish government in Coblence would be given more authority over it's internal affairs, allowing it to directly deal with Rhenish issues and efficently as possible. While his plan isn't perfect it's very popular with the Rhenish people."
rhi.105.d:0 "The political situation in the Rhine has collapsed. People are demanding major reforms for there nation. While this may help the situation in the short term it would also lessen our influence over the Rhineland."
rhi.200.d:0 "Despite the shock from the international community it is of no surprise that the Rhineland Referendum ended in a majority vote for German unification. The Rhine is German and has always been. The path towards a united Greater Germany marches ever closer."
rhi.201.d:0 "In ashocking turn of events the brainwashed Rhenish people have voted to maintain the status quo of there nation. It is obvious to most that this referendum was fraudulent and can not be taken as any way legitimate. If reunification can't be achieved peacefully we may have to take it by force."
rhi.202.d:0 "Despite being a corner stone of the French nation, the politicians in Paris and Coblence have refused to listen to the voice of there people. Millions of Germans remain trap under an oppressive foreign nation with no hope of reuniting with there families across the river. We must march into the Rhineland and liberate our fellow Germans."
