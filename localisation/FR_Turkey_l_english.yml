#### Events ####
tur.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire"
tur.1.d:0 "When [Root.GetNameDef] had joined the Great War on the side of the Central Powers, they had not expected the tough battle and disastrous defeat that followed. The conclusion of the Great War had saw [Root.GetNameDef] nearly dissolve, with the British fanning the flames for Arabian nationalism in the empire’s Arabian vilayets. In addition, when [Root.GetNameDef] was forced to the negotiation table, they were occupied and carved up by the Entente powers – namely Britain, Greece, France, and Italy.\n\nWhat remained of the Ottoman Empire, which was now limited to Anatolia and Constantinople, was forced to accept a government of the Entente’s choosing, with the Sultan as a figurehead. Thus, the Freedom and Entente Party had taken power in the nation, under the guidance of the Entente.\n\nWhat followed after was a revolt by Mustafa Kemal Paşa, a brigadier general in the Ottoman Army, who had sought to kick out the imperialists from Turkey and modernize the nation. A joint Anglo-Greek intervention force ended these dreams, when Mustafa Kemal and his group of revolutionaries were all defeated in a short, but bloody, battle.\n\nEver since the aforementioned event, the Sultan, Abdülmecid II, has managed to hold onto power, with the backing of the Entente. However, the political situation is very turbulent, with factionalism very much prevalent, and may crack at any time..."

tur.2.t:0 "The Assassination of the Sultan!"
tur.2.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, it seems as though the Sultan, Abdülmecid II was recently assassinated by an [Root.GetAdjective] revolutionary, who was reportedly unhappy with the state of [Root.GetNameDef]. This event has come as a shock to not only many within our nation, but also international observers, all of whom are attempting to come to terms with the situation. While tensions within [Root.GetNameDef] had been high following our disastrous defeat in the Great War, nobody had thought that it would come to this.\n\nAs it stands, the House of Osman is attempting to consolidate their power in an attempt to avoid the collapse of the nation, and an emergency session has been scheduled by the General Assembly to discuss the future of [Root.GetNameDef].

As it stands, the state of our empire is very turbulent, with unease and uncertainty both hanging in the air as the nation awaits the decision of the General Assembly. The people themselves, who feel as though they are helpless and unable to change the current situation, have turned their attention towards this emergency meeting which will determine the stability and unity of our empire – or the lack thereof.\n\nWhile a majority of the attendees, especially those from the House of Osman and the Freedom and Entente Party, support the swift consolidation of power under the House of Osman. However, an ever growing minority, mostly comprised of the Kemalists and Turanists, have been petitioning for the destruction of the empire and the rebirth of a new Turkish nation, with voting now beginning.\n\nWith voting now over, and the votes being tallied, the attendees are now holding their breath, waiting to see what the results of the vote show.\n\nAs the final votes have now been counted, it has just been announced that..."

The state itself will be dissolved promptly, with the creation of a new Turkish state rising from its ashes.\n\nThe Kemalists and Turanists have argued for a state that is focused exclusively on supporting the needs and whims of the Turkish people rather than the wider Muslim world. This, of course, will not endear us to other Islamic nations as with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire comes the dissolution of the Caliphate.\n\nThere are, however, other matters to consider with one of them being the election between the Kemalists and the Turanists, who will have to convince the delegates in attendance to vote for them to lead the new Turkish state.\n\nAs the voting is beginning, yet again, it seems though most of the people are in favour of the Kemalists leading the new state, yet the Turanists may be able to scrape by with a victory.\n\nWith the votes now tallied it seems as though..."

As it stands, there are two contenders for the throne: Ahmed Nihad Efendi, the grandson of the former Sultan Mehmed V, who is much more moderate and calls for the liberalization of the empire. Or Osman Fuad Efendi, son of Şehzade Mehmed Selahaddin, who opts to restore the empire to its former glory through conquest and militarization, while also empowering the post of the Sultan. Both sides have gained admirers and dissidents but only one can hope to win.\n\nWho shall we choose to lead [Root.GetNameDef]?"

Particularly anti-monarchist and revolutionary elements within [Root.GetNameDef] have suggested that we merely execute the royal family and its members, but this could harm our reputation within the wider international community.\n\nWe must, however, make a choice, and act decisively.

Thankfully, it seems as though, through a combination of keeping on top of the bureaucrats while also implementing effective reforms, [Root.GetNameDef] has become a more bureaucratically efficient state. This has allowed for not only more qualified bureaucrats to step up and take positions within the government, but for common citizens to more easily handle their day to day affairs in relation to the government. The reforms certainly have shown and have made [Root.GetNameDef] a better nation.\n\nIn addition, this has come to a shock to international observers, who were, at first, skeptical of our reformation efforts.

We must make sure that the reforms which had been previously brought about, such as the continued creation and use of Mecelle alongside fair/public trials for our citizens, are properly enforced in order to give every citizen of the empire a chance to speak out and an opportunity for freedom.

Efforts to curtail this blatant act of, what some may consider, treason against the empire must be made.

tur.20.d:0 "By constricting the parties that are in direct opposition, whether explicitly or implicitly, to our goals, we can ensure that parliamentary representatives that are elected are more favourable towards what we consider to be optimal. This will mean that a lot of the republican and left leaning parties will lose representation and the Sultan will manage to, slowly but surely, take the reins through the manipulation of the existing system."
tur.20.a:0 "Excellent."

tur.21.t:0 "Judicial Control"
tur.21.d:0 "The Sultan has decided to step in and reverse many of the reforms that had been made to the judicial system during the late nineteenth century. Non-Muslims shall no longer enjoy the freedoms they once had, and trials shall now favour the people we consider true Ottomans. In addition, the Sultan shall be given more power to freely enforce Kanuns and his word will be considered final by all. We cannot hope to leave the judicial system in the hands of corrupt or inefficient judges if we are to truly save the empire."

tur.22.d:0 "We must look towards appointing the a loyal Grand Vizier as a way to help provide more legitimacy to our rule whilst also making it appear to the masses as though the Sultan does not have absolute power when, in fact, he does. In what is considered as a smart, yet somewhat risky, move by observers at home and abroad, Sultan Osman IV has decided to appoint Mustafa Fevzi Paşa as the new Grand Vizier. Once the Minister of War for [Root.GetNameDef], Mustafa Fevzi Paşa’s expertise in matters of war will certainly help with overseeing the development of a mobilized and active Ottoman state, ready to take action against all who have wronged it."

We cannot allow such an institution, which hurts not only our state but our way of life, to continue and must look towards its immediate removal.\n\nOf course, this will not endear us to our political opposition, who may now look towards doing all that they can to stop our initiative. In addition, the opposition within the country itself is already having a hard time digesting our current reforms, so this could lead them to do unspeakable things. For now, we must keep watch..."

tur.25.t:0 "A New Alphabet"
tur.25.d:0 "One of the proposed reforms of the Kemalists was the institution of a new alphabet.

In addition, the ‘Turkification’ and removal of various Arabian and Persian loan words shall commence as soon as possible.\n\nOn top of all this, however, the Kemalists have now passed the Surname Law, which will force all citizens of [Root.GetNameDef] to adopt a surname and abolishing the titles during the time of the Ottoman Empire."

tur.26.t:0 "Banning the Fez?"
tur.26.d:0 "A hot topic between the members of the General National Assembly was banning the fez.

While banning the fez could help modernization efforts, it risks angering a substantial portion of the population."

tur.26.b:0 "On second thought, this isn't that important..."

tur.27.t:0 "Status of our Legal Code"
tur.27.d:0 "The old Ottoman legal code was one that was extremely confusing, due to incorporating secular and religious law, and, oftentimes, favoured the Muslim majority within the nation. The Kemalists want to do away with what they consider to be an old and outdated legal code and institute a secular law structure based off of the Swiss Civil Code. This has garnered the support of many people, who wish to see a fairer system in place but risks angering traditionalists and members of the clergy."

tur.28.d:0 "The Kemalists wish to do away with the Rumi calendar, which begins on 622 AD (the year of Muhammad’s emigration), and institute the more widely used and western Gregorian calendar. This is not very popular with the public as they see the reform itself as too minute to make a difference, while the traditionalists are not in favour of the adoption of what they consider to be a western calendar. What should we do?"
tur.28.a:0 "We must go ahead."

tur.29.t:0 "The Question of Women's Rights"
tur.29.d:0 "Society within the Ottoman Empire was known to be very tradition and women had next to no political rights. By advancing the idea of women’s rights, we can allow for better representation within our country (by enacting universal suffrage and equality laws) and help further productivity and equal participation within Turkish society. Of course, this will not endear us to many of the more traditional members of our society. What shall we do?"

Not long ago the German regime has taken it upon themselves to 'right the wrongs' of the Great War and create a New Germany that would strech from the Meuse to the Neman once more. Surprisingly, the Germans are looking to be a very formidible enemy for the Entente as France and Italy are having difficulty in putting them down. Perhaps we can be the weight that tips the scales in this new war, and we have no doubt that Germany would accept an offer for an alliance given their position."

tur.31.d:0 "In a surprising move, the former terminally ill man of Europe has sent a request to join the Stahlpakt. Following the Great War, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned in a much more brutal fashion than the German Empire. Italy took Panfilia coupled with France taking portions of Syria, Lebanon and Hantab which would lead to the creation of Phoenicia. \n\n The Ottomans sit in a strategically valuable area in the Middle-east, having them as an ally would certainly inconvenience the French and Italians substantially...

Agreeing as our nations have formed Brotherly-ties in the Great War, Adam Dressler has vowed to see ALL of the victims of versailles restored to their former greatness. With a new German-Turkish axis formed, a real empire ruled by Turks seems closer now than it did in the closing years of the Great War. \n Trade Routes have been planned, Turkish and German Military Staff are now undertaking meetings, and prominent German and Turkish political leaders are making visits to eachother; our bonds with Germany seem to be stronger than steel."

The mindless dictator known as 'Adam Dressler' has cited that we were a minimally useful Ally in the Great War and were likely to be even worse considering how brutally partitioned we were in the Conferences of Versailles. We have managed to refrain from mentioning that Germany herself was incredibly humiliated in the Versailles Accord, but the problem stands. We have been locked out of the Stahlpakt and our lands still lie in the hands of the French and Italians. What shall we do?"

Unfortunately for the Italians, they have lost a war without being able to switch sides in time. The mainland Italian Peninsula is firmly in German Control, and we have ample opportunity to retake our rightful lands with the Italian government scrambling to assemble themselves in Africa.

Little do those Vultures know, we could very well resist an invasion of northern syria, however doing so would require us to delegate military resources to a non-vital front. It might be in our best interests to let this slide and deal with the Turks once we retake the homeland."

tur.38.t:0 "Modernizing our Bureaucracy"
tur.38.d:0 "It is no secret to both citizens of [Root.GetName] and international observers that the Ottoman Empire was a decadent and crumbling state with a bureaucracy to match. Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency were widespread in the former empire and considered commonplace or were not properly dealt with. This has, unfortunately, carried on into [Root.GetNameDef]. We must take steps to ensure that officials hired are both effective at their job and willing to work for the interests of not themselves, but the state. In addition, the Turkish Public Administration has been founded to replace the old Ottoman bureaucracy. Hopefully, a fresh start is what will help our endeavours."
tur.38.a:0 "Onward!"

tur.39.t:0 "Bureaucratic Modernization Successful!"
tur.39.d:0 "Thankfully, it seems as though our efforts to modernize the bureaucracy have, for the most part, paid off. While we still have a long road ahead of us in order to properly reach the level of success that we truly want to see, it is a good start and, already, the Turkish government, in its daily functions, has begun to perform various tasks more efficiently and is better able to meet the needs of the people."

While this is, by no means, a good thing, it is clear that there is hope for [Root.GetNameDef] and its people. Because while the traditionalists and clergymen have managed to defeat us at present, there were certain groups of people who were receptive towards our reforms and wish to see the Republic as a secular, modern, and westernized state..."

tur.42.d:0 "By deferring to the local governments and ridding the administrative system of its centralized nature, we can help ensure better representation for the people and, consequently, assure a true democratic state. This also assists us in our endeavour of making the administrative and bureaucratic systems themselves more efficient, as the local governments shall no longer have to follow directives from the national government in Constantinople.

tur.59.t:0 "Rooting out Leftists"
tur.59.d:0 "We’ve used the paramilitary groups under our thumb to our advantage by having them identify and assassinate prominent leftists.

tur.60.d:0 "Despite having been rid of the Ottoman Empire once and for all, we still have retained much of the issues that had plagued the empire. For example, our bureaucracy inefficient and in shambles, largely ineffective and unable to do its job properly. Corruption is rampant and a lack of being unable to industrialize has hurt our economy. We must take to reforming the very core of the state and creating a robust Turkish state."
tur.60.a:0 "We shall be successful!"

tur.61.t:0 "Dealing With the Bureaucracy"
tur.61.d:0 "As stated before, the bureaucracy that we had inherited was one that was ineffective and able to even perform the simplest of tasks properly. That is why we have taken to creating the Turkish Public Administration, firing old guard bureaucrats, and replacing them with capable men who are able to efficiently and effectively complete their tasks. In addition anti-corruption measures have been implemented in order to prevent such decadence from ever occurring within the Turkish nation ever again. The only question is: will our efforts be successful?"
tur.61.a:0 "Let's hope they will be..."

tur.62.t:0 "Bureaucratic Efforts Successful"
tur.62.d:0 "Thankfully, it seems as though our efforts to modernize the bureaucracy have, for the most part, paid off. While we still have a long road ahead of us in order to properly reach the level of success that we truly want to see, it is a good start and, already, the Turkish government, in its daily functions, has begun to perform various tasks more efficiently and is better able to meet the needs of the people."
tur.62.a:0 "Amazing!"

tur.63.t:0 "Judicial Control"
tur.63.d:0 "We must begin to take matters into our own hands; rather than allowing an independent judiciary to exist, we must turn to nations such as the United States, which allow the president, who is the head of the executive branch, to appoint judges as he sees fit. However, we shall also put in our own caveat: the president will be allowed to fire judges as he sees fit. The judiciary itself shall be, of course, overseen by the president."
tur.63.a:0 "Onward!"

tur.64.t:0 "Shutting Down Parliament"
tur.64.d:0 "We can no longer allow this farce of a government to exist. Prior to our ascendance to power, the parliament was a largely paralyzed institution and had a ton of infighting, which meant nothing would ever get done. Indeed, it was the parliament themselves who had made the decision to surrender the Turkish state into the hands of the imperialist Entente powers. How can an institution that displays such brazen cowardice be allowed to exist? No, we must take our own measures and suspend parliament indefinitely..."
tur.64.a:0 "This is a necessary measure..."

tur.65.t:0 "Revolution Has Broken Out!"
tur.65.d:0 "We’ve just received disastrous news! Apparently, our political opposition has taken matters into their own hands, mobilizing the general population against us! The Liberals and Kemalists have managed to overcome their differences and have forged a coalition against us, vowing to take us out, declaring themselves the true heirs of the [Root.GetAdjective] nation. We cannot allow them to tarnish the name of our great empire in such a manner and we must take decisive action as soon as possible."

turnews.1.t:0 "The Invasion of [ARM.GetName]"
turnews.1.d:0 "The dismantling of the Ottoman Empire by the Entente has been criticized by many expert minds as being an unsustainable situation, not the least of which is due to revanchism that was bound to appear in the disgraced Sultanate. Control of the "Armenian Highlands" was given to the titular nation-state, despite much of the region being heavily settled by Ottoman Turks.\n\nThe Ottomans have trumpeted that such "rightful territory" should be under their demesne, demanding the region of Eastern Trabzon from Armenia, while calling for a referendum in Erserum. But the Armenian government has refused the cession of this territory. The order was given from Istanbul for the army to begin an invasion."

turnews.2.d:0 "The Kurdish state owes its existence to the partition of the Ottoman Empire, and it is no shock that this has made them a target of Turkish revanchism. A military build-up by both parties has resulted in border skirmishes along the border between Kurdistan and the imperial remnant. The Ottomans claim the death of their border guard demands retribution, while the Kurds have accused the Ottomans of instigating war.\n\nRegardless of which side is telling the truth, the Turks have used this incident as a pretext for an invasion of Kurdistan with the stated intention to 'restore order'."

turnews.3.d:0 "Demilitarized in the peace treaty that formally ended hostilities between the Entente Cordiale and the Ottoman Empire in the wake of the Great War, the Bosphorus Straits and Istanbul itself have been devoid of any military presence for well over a decade.\n\nWith the new Government in power in [From.GetName], they have made clear their willingness to reinstate total control over all of their territory, including the Bosphorus Straits. It comes as no surprise then that this morning the Turkish Government officially marked the end of the demilitarization of the Straits by moving troops into the region."
