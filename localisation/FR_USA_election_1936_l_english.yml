usa.election.1936.1.t:0 "1936 Progressive National Convention"
usa.election.1936.1.d:0 "Cleveland, Ohio. The Progressive National Convention has begun to choose which candidate- Quentin Roosevelt or Alf Landon- will carry the torch of the party to the national ballot box in November. Roosevelt, who has sworn to continue the social reforms of his late cousin Teddy (and his VP Hiram Johnson) to reach not just equality between the sexes, but the races as well. Alf Landon, meanwhile, is more focused on fixing the American economy. Though many of his proposed methods have been considered rather dubious, many Progressives are steadfast in their commitment that his resolution of the unemployment and debt crisis by focusing on small business will save America. Which one of these two will be chosen for the position remains to be seen…"

usa.election.1936.2.d:0 "Philidelphia, Pennsylvania. The Democratic National Convention is currently being held to decide who will receive the nomination of the Democratic Party in the Presidential election of 1936. Though the previous several months have been an exceptionally turbulent and difficult time, the party is finally coming together to choose the person to represent them. Huey Long, the longtime firebrand and thorn in the side of the typically conservative Democratic establishment has secured a large following, though it has swayed back and forth since he announced his running for the candidacy. His opponent- John Nance Garner- represents a conservative and more defense-focused portion of the Party, looking to the border with Mexico and its consuming tensions. Who, now, amongst them will take up the mantle?"
